\f0\fs32 \cf2 Over the course of preparing this thesis, I have received so much support from others. First, I\'92d like to express my gratitude to Professor Janice McCabe for inspiring me to pursue an undergraduate major in sociology and guiding me through this thesis. Without her guidance, knowledge, and coincidentally, her mentorship, this thesis would not have been possible.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I\'92d also like to thank Professor Kimberly Rogers for all her help in revising my thesis and answering my questions. It was her expertise in this subject that clarified much of the sociological theory behind my work.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I\'92d also like to thank the entire Department of Sociology for their education and inspiration these past few years at Dartmouth. Each person has helped me become the person and thesis writer I am now. Included in the department are my fellow sociology thesis writers. Their camaraderie and support was invaluable for pushing me to this final product.

And we gain the ability to figure out who we want to be separate than our parent, separate than our home town, separate than whatever identity we had previous to coming to college. And mentors are people who can help you figure out who that is and who you want to be.\'94

\f0\fs32 \cf2 As described by this Dartmouth College junior, mentorships are extremely important relationships that facilitate development for both inexperienced and experienced members of a setting. They occur both programmatically and organically in a number of settings, including college and the workplace. The quote above from Joe highlights the huge role mentorship can play in guiding someone\'92s integration into college and the quality of a person\'92s college experience, benefits of mentorship well-documented in prior work by Hu and Ma (2010). Furthermore, mentorships in college can lead to stronger professional skills that transfer beyond undergraduate years. Campbell et al. (2012) assert that mentorships are strong indicators of college students\'92 leadership development; being in a mentorship relationship increases leadership capacities for both mentors and mentees. Furthermore, especially for students of underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, mentorships can encourage students to pursue further and higher educational degrees (Lang 1986).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Because of the importance of mentorship in enhancing the futures of college students, it is unsurprising that mentorships are also important for advancing careers in the workplace. Mentorship is a key component of building social capital and advancements in professional spaces. Career mobility, promotions, compensation, and overall enjoyment of work are all benefits of mentorship relationships in workplaces (Ragins and Scandura 1999). Mentorships are especially significant for helping underrepresented workers, such as women in male-dominated fields (Cox and Nkomo 1986). Increasing numbers of Americans, including women are entering business and entrepreneurship, with 850,000 new businesses sprouting up each year in the US. Mentorship plays a particularly large role in providing information, encouragement, and role models to those entering entrepreneurship (Banir et al. 2011). These relationships could be a key means of uplifting disadvantaged groups and bridging inequalities in both college and workplace settings. Unfortunately, gender inequalities persist through unequal access to mentorship relationships and experiences within mentorship relationships.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Gender is a diffuse status characteristic, meaning that it carries both general and specific expectations of competence and applies to a variety of settings. Cultural beliefs of gender include expectations that men are more competent at most tasks, especially those requiring technical, mechanical, and leadership skills. Women on the other hand, are better suited for tasks of nurturing and care (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). These status beliefs about gender result in inequalities between men and women\'92s access to mentorship and social capital (Kay and Wallace 2009). Gender inequalities in the workplace are particularly thoroughly studied. Women tend to hold fewer managerial positions and positions of authority than men do, and men more often share their social network with other men than with other women (Beggs and Hulbert 1997). In initiating mentorships, mentors gravitate towards mentees with stereotypically male qualities of assertiveness, because mentors feel that masculine qualities are better associated with potential for advancement (Scandura and Ragins 1993; McGuire 2002). In the past however, studies tended to ask only how gender affected the mentee experience of mentor relationships.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Due to the important influence of gender expectations on mentorship relationships, I asked the question, how does the gender of the mentor affect the mentor\'92s motivations and expectations to mentor? To further explore this relationship, I asked this question in two settings, a college setting and a workplace setting. Gender has been previously studied as a variable with effects on mentee outcomes and experiences; however, I sought to find out how status beliefs about gender affect the mentor side of the relationship. Mentorships are oftentimes considered reciprocal relationships, requiring participation from both sides (Crisp and Cruz 2009), and the importance of the relationship cannot be understood without studying both parties involved. As discussed before, there are different expectations of men\'92s and women\'92s competencies in several skills important to mentoring. These include leadership, assertiveness, and abilities to confer psychosocial and instrumental support (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). How does mentorship then differ when it is delivered by a man versus a woman? Additionally, because the salience of status characteristics depends on setting and context (Correll and Ridgeway 2003), are the results the same in college and workplace settings?
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 I answer my question through a cross-sectional and qualitative approach. To understand the perceptions of mentors, I employed semi-structured interviews with participants, ranging anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half. Because my goal is to flesh out mentor experiences and opinions, the depth and validity associated with interviews is a strength of my study. However, my study may not be generalizable due to the uniqueness of each interview and the small sample size. As a comparative study, I also performed these interviews with two samples. The college sample contained 13 participants, including 8 men and 5 women, and the workplace sample contained 15 participants, including 7 men and 8 women. I acquired both samples through nonprobability sampling, which is appropriate given the time intensity, detail, and honesty I asked of participants. Nonprobability sampling provided participants who were most interested and willing to give meaningful and detailed responses during interviews. For the college sample, I acquired my participants through general recruitment emails to freshmen mentorship programs at Dartmouth, and then asked participants to recommend friends for me to contact. For the workplace sample, I contacted mentors listed in a \'93mentor directory\'94 of the business accelerator, MassChallenge. Following data collection, which spanned from July 2015 to January 2016, I performed data analysis through Atlas.ti software. Using one of Dartmouth College\'92s key-served versions, I coded the interviews both deductively and inductively. Ultimately, these codes demonstrated gender differences in the motivations and expectations to mentor in both of the settings.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In this thesis, I proceed through six chapters, each describing key aspects of my study. In Chapter 2, I review the applicable literature and present both sociological theory and prior findings relevant to my study. Chapter 2 also distinguishes key gaps in literature, which I hope to address through my research. In Chapter 3, I describe and reflect on my methodology, including my selection and operationalization of variables, recruitment methods, sampling methods, data analysis process, and ethical concerns. Chapter 4 describes the results of my analysis. Chapter 4 focuses on results of the college sample, while Chapter 5 focuses on results of the workplace sample. In these chapters, I draw comparisons between the samples and between my results and those anticipated by prior literature. In Chapter 6, the conclusion, I summarize the results, present practical recommendations for mentorship initiatives, suggest implications of my results on sociological theory, and reflect on potential focuses and methodologies for future research about gender and mentorship. At the very end of my thesis, I also include several appendices, including my interview guide, recruitment email, and consent form.\page

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The term \'93mentor\'94 typically refers to an individual with experience and knowledge, who is committed to supporting the development of someone more junior, called a \'93prot\'e9g\'e9\'94 or \'93mentee\'94 (Smith-Jentsch et al. 2004). While social scientists disagree on a precise universal definition of mentorship, Crisp and Cruz (2009) identify three primary components that reoccur in research on mentorship. First, mentorships center on the maturation and accomplishment of an individual, the mentee. Second, there are multiple ways to support a mentee, including psychosocial assistance, career assistance, and role modeling. Third, these relationships are personal and reciprocal (Crisp and Cruz 2009). While definitions tend to assert that mentorships are reciprocal, the primary characteristics are mentee-centric.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In this chapter, I review the relevant scholarly work on mentorship and identify important gaps in literature. The chapter begins by focusing on mentorship itself and its impact and benefits on mentorship participants. While the focus of my thesis is not on racial minorities or socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, I describe a few selected studies that underline the positive effects of mentorship for these groups. These studies not only demonstrate that mentorship can confer significant advantages to participants, but also convey the lack of mentorship studies geared towards gender distinctions. In the next subsection, I explain the ingrained gender inequalities that result from uneven distributions of social capital and social networks in colleges and workplaces, and which mentorship relationships serve to expand and strengthen. The final subsection of this chapter details how gender-related expectations can have particular impact on how mentors deliver, perceive, and reflect on mentorship. This subsection also illustrates the important sociological theories that explain differences in mentorship experiences for men and women.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Benefits of Mentorship
\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Mentorship typically serves two functions for the mentee: psychosocial support and career development (Smith-Jentsch et al. 2004). Psychosocial support is much like personal support. Through psychosocial support, the mentee gains a stronger sense of self and more satisfying social relations (Davidson and Foster-Johnson 2001). Career development, which Davidson and Foster-Johnson (2001) refer to as instrumental support, includes skill enhancement, increased professional contacts, and advice on a professional path. Particularly in settings in which peers work in close contact with each other and build meaningful relationships, the psychosocial and career support conferred in mentorship can yield significant outcomes in success and satisfaction (Lockwood 2006). 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Existing literature supports that mentees benefit from mentorships, regardless of the environment. Among undergraduates, mentorship by older students can help facilitate academic and social integration, both key components of satisfaction and commitment in college (Hu and Ma 2010). Other researchers have documented that mentorship produces positive results in higher education settings for underrepresented mentees, such as racial minorities. A problem in higher education is that many African American students become disillusioned with negative experiences in the educational system. However, academic and career mentoring encourages students to pursue further and higher educational degrees (Lang 1986). Mentorship is also a key contributor to leadership development in both the mentor and the mentee. In general, mentees increase their leadership capacities through the skills and role modeling provided by their mentors, and mentors are able to practice and improve their leadership abilities from the leadership position of a mentor (Campbell et al. 2012). The leadership abilities conferred by mentorships are highly transferrable to professional environments, and can be especially useful for boosting struggling or underrepresented groups.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In the workplace, mentorship can also influence the mentee\'92s career mobility, promotions, compensation, and overall enjoyment of work (Ragins and Scandura 1999). Entrepreneurial environments are becoming an increasingly prevalent type of workplace with 11% of Americans working to start a business and 850,000 new businesses sprouting up each year (Banir et al. 2011). Banir et al. (2011) asserts that in this particular environment, mentorship is helpful as a source of information, encouragement, and role models. The benefits of mentorship can be particularly helpful towards increasing satisfaction and upward mobility of underrepresented groups. Another study asserts a positive association between mentorship and upward mobility of African American managers in corporate positions (Cox and Nkomo 1986). Mentorship\'92s potential to reduce disadvantageous factors in academic and professional settings underlines its importance.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Less understood is the perspective of the mentor and the benefits conferred to the mentor in a mentorship relationship. While the experience and success of mentorship relationships is often measured through the lens of the mentee, these relationships are also arguably subjective. The relationship requires input from both parties, and given the mentor\'92s contribution of time, effort, and even reputation, research should also examine the expectations, experiences, and outcomes of mentors (Steele 2012). Mentors choose to be mentors for a number of different reasons and for a number of different benefits. Previous work categorizes these benefits into altruistic, cognitive, social, and personal growth (Beltman and Schaeben 2012). Mentors that experience altruistic benefits feel an intangible sense of satisfaction and reward from helping others. They feel pride in achievements of the mentees and satisfaction in passing on their experience and knowledge. Cognitive benefits refer to acquisition of new knowledge or skills, including leadership skills, communicational skills, social skills, or career development. Social benefits include expansion of one\'92s social network and interactions with new friends. Personal growth benefits refer to personal development and acquisition of confidence, pride, and a sense of purpose or responsibility through reflection on the mentorship (Beltman and Schaeben 2012). These categories of mentor benefits will become important in the results chapters.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 These types of mentor benefits can ultimately fall into classifications of psychosocial and career-oriented benefits, just like the benefits received by mentees. While Beltman and Schaeben (2012) define mentor benefits into four categories, their categories closely resemble psychosocial support and career support, the two main mentee benefits mentees gain from mentorships. The feelings of satisfaction, pride, and purpose from helping people, as well as the expansion of one\'92s network of friends are all psychosocial benefits. Acquiring new skills or knowledge from someone new to the mentor\'92s environment is way of gaining career support. Because both mentors and mentees benefit from the two sides of the same coin; there is even more reason to study and understand mentorship from both perspectives.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 While it is clear that mentorship programs are highly important to psychosocial and career development for all parties involved, mentorship studies have struggled to produce findings in formats that are comparable across studies. There is a lack of standardized means to measure and understand quality of mentorship and mentorship experiences (Ragins and McFarlin 1990) in different environments. Different studies focus on different settings of mentorship, define mentorship differently, and analyze and organize the results differently. Through a comparative analysis of mentorships, I produce flexible, in-depth results that allow comparison of mentorships in two contexts.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 This comparison is most useful and most easily produced through examination of formal mentorships. Mentorship relationships can occur both informally and formally. Informal relationships occur organically between individuals, while formal mentorships are associated with a program that assigns mentorship dyads (Allen and Eby 2004). While both types of mentorship occur, instituting or improving organizational mentorship programs offers the most promise of making widespread impact on psychosocial and career support. Informal mentorship is spontaneous, and formed on an individual-by-individual basis; therefore, any findings on how to improve informal mentorships would not be very actionable. \'a0Given the significance of formal mentorships, it is also concerning that most studies find formal mentorship to be less effective in conferring career and psychosocial support. Mentees report better mentoring in informal mentorships (Allen and Eby 2004). However, formal mentorship programs that encompass some aspects of informal mentorships, such as voluntary participation and choice in the matching process, have led to improved outcomes and satisfaction rates (Ragins, Cotton, and Miller 2000). This provides promising reason to focus on formal mentorships and to better them.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Access to Social Capital and Structural Gender Inequalities
\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Social networks influence the potential for mentorship relationships, and mentorships are also strategic means to expand social capital and mobility (Podolny and Baron 1997). Social capital refers to the knowledge, support, and institutional resources available in one\'92s social networks. People benefit from their social networks through the associated social capital, because social capital is the instrumental value associated with social ties (Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995). Increased social capital enhances positive outcomes such as better jobs, earlier promotions, higher earnings, or emotional benefits such as better mental health (Lin 2000). \'a0Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch (1995) even argue that the increased social ties acquired through mentorship relationships is a condition for engagement and advancement in educational and professional institutions. However, all groups do not uniformly acquire nor utilize social capital in a network.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Social capital is unequal across different social groups. Lin (2000) proposes that these inequalities stem from two primary explanations. First, inequalities occur due to clustering of particular groups in disadvantaged positions within the network. Second, homophily, the general tendency for individuals to support those who share with them socioeconomic or other status characteristics, maintains social capital inequalities. Most existing work on social capital inequalities explores inequalities in the workplace. One of the most prominent divisions in social capital occurs across gender differences in the workplace. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Both explanations result in a concentration of access and social capital that is unequally distributed between genders. Studies show that men have greater access to professional information, business opportunities, and professional achievement (Lin 2000). Their networks tend to be larger than those of women. However, their networks also include more associations with other men than with women (Beggs and Hurlbert 1997). This uneven distribution of capital perpetuates through mentorships that do not yield the same outcomes for men and women.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The cycle perpetuates gender inequalities in many different ways. From the start, the way mentors select mentees is gendered: mentors gravitate towards mentees who are more assertive and outgoing--characteristics more often associated with men (Scandura and Ragins 1993). Even in studies in which mentors offer the same frequency of mentorship to both genders, mentors still feel biased towards helping men, because many mentors believe men have more potential for advancement (McGuire 2002). In scenarios in which male and female professionals are equally likely to secure mentors with similar social networks, men still have better outcomes than women in terms of promotions and earnings (Kay and Wallace 2009). The result is that women continue to hold managerial positions and positions of power less frequently than men, also leading to less female mentors. Because simply having mentors is not enough, further research must delve into details of the relationship.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Some recent literature also exposes that gender inequalities persist specifically in entrepreneurial environments. While women are becoming more and more involved in typically male-dominated fields, such as entrepreneurship, men still outnumber women in this field twofold. This is due to a combination of factors including socially constructed expectations regarding gender and limited social, cultural, and financial capital to attract investors (Gupta et al. 2009). Overall, the business world continues to be masculine, and perpetuates expectations of men\'92s and women\'92s competencies in this environment (Correll and Ridgeway 2003).
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	There is much less work that explores the effect of gender on access to social capital in college settings. This gap in literature might result from researchers believing that gender inequalities do not persist significantly in academic settings; studies of gender and mentorship tend to focus on career outcomes in professional settings. Some work addresses college performance and mentorship experiences for students of different races, ethnicities, or socioeconomic status; yet, literature about the role of gender in collegiate mentorship experiences is underdeveloped. Given the salience of gender in affecting mentorship and social networks in the workplace, it would be reasonable to relate those results to the education experience. My study directly addresses if there is or is not a relative difference in gender inequalities between collegiate and workplace environments. By looking at mentorship relationships, I will compare the social capital provided by mentors in two settings. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 These structural gender inequalities have also impeded research on the role of gender in mentorship relationships. Ragins and McFarlin (1990) recognize that there are primarily three obstacles to furthering research and knowledge on gender\'92s influence on mentorship relationships. First, the inequality of men and women in organizational rank clouds subtler impacts of gender in mentorship interactions. Organizational rank often becomes a confounding variable. Second, researchers also struggle to acquire sufficient samples of female mentors, largely because female mentors are less frequently in positions of power to act as effective mentors. Third, there is no standardized means to measure and understand qualitative features of mentorship relationships. In my comparative analysis, I plan to face these issues to produce two sets of parallel data in which the quality of mentorship relationships involving men and involving women can be studied.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Gender Expectations
\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Because gender is such a salient characteristic, gender expectations can shape mentorship experiences. Gender affects assumptions mentors and mentees make of each other and the mentoring they deem appropriate (Ridgeway 2001). Traditional gender roles, for example, suggest that female mentors focus more on psychosocial support, and male mentors provide more career development support, partially due to the more executive positions of men in their organizations (Lockwood 2006). As a result, even in leadership positions, women lead through a more democratic, participatory manner, while men are more directive and autocratic (Eagly, Makhijani, and Klonsky 1992). Otherwise, in the workplace, men typically participate more, are expected to participate more, and demonstrate more confidence, assertion, and influence than women in workplace settings. The relevance of gender is even stronger when the task at hand is considered masculine (Ridgeway 2001). In turn, mentees also internalize gender stereotypes and project gender expectations onto their mentors (Allen and Eby 2004). These expectations may be self-fulfilling, and influence the mentorship delivered by the mentor (Ridegeway and Smith-Lovin 1999).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Status characteristics, such as gender, can lead to expectations of individuals\'92 abilities to perform in certain tasks. Gender is a diffuse status characteristic, meaning that it carries both general and specific expectations of competence and applies to a variety of settings. While gender is quite salient in most environments compared to other status characteristics, the salience of even diffuse status characteristics can also vary between different contexts. The combination of various status characteristics an individual possesses interacts with the tasks at hand in each situation. Furthermore, specific status characteristics, which apply only to specific tasks, can become important when conducting those specific tasks. Specific status characteristics are abilities or skills which when relevant, can sometimes have more impact that diffuse status characteristics. For the most part though, gender will affect roles such as manager, employee, student, or mentor to varying degrees depending on the situation (Ridgeway 2001). Despite knowledge that the impact of gender depends on circumstance, little to no research has tried to compare the impact in two or more mentorship settings.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Status beliefs oftentimes form around status characteristics that influence performance expectations and interactions among individuals. Status beliefs are socially constructed consensual evaluations that deem one category as more status worthy and competent than the other. Even more influential than what individuals think of themselves (first order expectations) and what others think of an individual (second order expectations) is what an individual thinks society thinks of them (third order expectations), which are status beliefs. Status beliefs about gender suggest that men and women have different competencies, with women being much more proficient in nurturing and caring tasks, and men more competent at technical, mechanical, and authoritative tasks. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Different competencies lead to different performance expectations, which are unconscious anticipations of the quality of individual\'92s performance at a task. Sociologists have learned that through a process called status averaging, people unconsciously sum the positive and negative status characteristics of individuals and then integrate to determine performance expectations. The different relative performance expectations of individuals result in different levels of influence, power, prestige, and confidence. In both stereotypically masculine and gender-neutral tasks, men experience higher prestige, confidence, influence, and performance expectations. This process falls under status characteristics theory, which describes how status beliefs about status characteristics become performance expectations that then shape behaviors and interactions in groups. Expectation states theory is the even larger umbrella, which encompasses the all underlying processes that lead to status structures (Correll and Ridgeway 2003; Ridgeway and Smith-Lovin 1999). Two of the ways status structures form and persist are behavioral interchange patterns and legitimacy. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 A behavioral interchange pattern occurs when two parties interact and one party demonstrates assertive, higher status behaviors, and the other party responds deferentially. As these patterns repeat, they became shared beliefs about typical behaviors of the two parties (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). For example, if a woman mentor continually acts with lower status behavior than a male mentor or a woman mentor demonstrates passive leadership abilities to the mentee, a mentee will make assumptions about men and women\'92s statuses, which leads to different performance expectations for men and women. Oftentimes, behavioral interchange patterns serve to reinforce the status expectations associated with gender, because both sides internalize and project these consensually understood expectations (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Due to issues of legitimacy, it is very difficult to overcome status beliefs about gender. Even when women achieve a higher valued status position, they experience resistance to asserting the same authority that men assert in that position (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Because use of an autocratic leadership style is more associated with men than women, literature shows that men who lead by an autocratic style received more favorable evaluations than women who lead by an autocratic style (Eagly, Makhijani, and Konsky 1999). The hierarchy is only legitimate when those expected to have higher statuses occupy the higher status (Correll and Ridgeway 2003).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 This project will focus on two organizational contexts in which mentorship relationships develop between young peers in close contact with each other. Both contexts provide settings to study gender\'92s impact on mentorship with minimal impact from formal hierarchies. There is also strong reason to believe that factors of social capital and gender roles will manifest differently in terms of the mentors\'92 motivations and expectations in mentorship relationships at collegiate and the entrepreneurial environments. In 2008, Smith-Jentsch et al. found that female peer mentors at the collegiate level offer more psychosocial support, and male mentors at the collegiate level offer more career support, while mentorship studies of the workplace describe the \'93quality\'94 of mentorship to be the same whether the mentor is male or female. Existing literature only addresses mentorship in these two contexts separately, even though both contexts are comparable in closeness of collaboration and potentially the quality and type of mentorship that develops.\page \page

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In this chapter, I describe and reflect on the methodology of my study. I start by explaining the cross-sectional and qualitative nature of my study, and I discuss the benefits and disadvantages of this design given the purposes of my study. One important consideration I discuss is the ethics of my methodology. Next, I identify the variables of my study, and subsequently give a full description of how the questions I ask in my answers my research question. I then go on to fully describe my process for recruiting participants of my two samples, and give detailed descriptions of the samples and research sites I chose. At the end of this subsection, I include a table that summarizes my two samples and their genders, both of which are independent variables in my study. Finally, my last subsection of this chapter explains my methods for data analysis, and I include a description of the software and codes used to understand the data collected.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Data collection was cross-sectional and qualitative, through scheduled semi-structured interviews with participants. Through these qualitative interviews, I examined the perception various mentors have towards their mentorship relationships. Interviews are useful for fleshing out processes, and the flexibility of my guide allowed me to tailor the interviews to gain further explanation about the processes as needed.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Interviews yield the most in-depth understanding of mentorship experiences. There is a high capacity of validity, as the interviewer is able to delve into the context and application of information from the respondent. Because I am more interested in descriptive relationships than causal trends, a qualitative approach was most appropriate for my study. The semi-structured format of my interviews furthermore produced results relatable within each sample group and between sample groups, while allowing for flexibility in the interviews. Interviews allowed me to achieve qualitative results that can be compared between samples in two environments. While reliability tends to be low for this method, because each interview is so individual, the use of an interview guide geared cohesively towards comparison of the two samples boosted reliability. There has been no prior study that provides information comparing a collegiate and professional environment.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 It is important to note potential disadvantages of qualitative interviews, as well. Unfortunately, interviews are time-intensive, which limited the sample sizes of my college and entrepreneurial groups. What I gained in deeper understanding might be lost in generalizability. However, I believe that the 15 interviews in my entrepreneur sample and 13interviews in my college sample were sufficient to prevent overrepresentation of any vastly outlier opinions. Furthermore, with increased understanding of the details and unique consequences surrounding each participant\'92s experiences, I was able to boost generalizability. Because I am not looking for quantitative trends, the variations were less concerning.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 There are also obstacles inherent to collecting data in face-to-face interviews. Some individuals might be uncomfortable revealing certain information in a face-to-face context if they are sensitive to how I portray and understand their perceptions of gender. I did my best to mitigate this problem by reminding them that the interview is entirely confidential and that I know that they are speaking from limited observation rather than knowledge or hard data. Also, by providing some basic information to participants prior to the interview, they understood the innocuous purpose of the study. Interviewer bias is another concern that all interviewers must address. I countered this by preparing the interview guide in advance to ensure that I gear the interview without bias.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 As an interviewer, but also a participant immersed in both communities, I believe that my position lent towards a greater degree of trust and comfort between the participant and I. This was especially prominent in the entrepreneurial sample when some participants spoke to me about business strategies, even though I could only follow conversations of technical expertise slightly. In both samples, I believe participants felt like they were less likely to be misunderstood or have their answers misconstrued due to a lack of researcher knowledge about the context. Because I positioned myself less as an outsider and more as an active participant in their community, I believe I received more honest and open responses.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 However, it was not only the perception of being more knowledgeable that was helpful, but also having knowledge of the settings. Being an active member of both these settings helped me understand the contexts of the participants\'92 opinions and stories. Especially since each interview is inevitably different and each mentor has different experiences, it\'92s helpful to be familiar with the norms of interactions in the settings. Interviews innately involve more validity, because the interviewer can learn about each response in great detail, but validity can also stem from experimenter familiarity with the contexts.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Ethical Concerns
\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 While this study poses no great ethical concerns, I have also taken care to gain approval from the Committee for Protection of Human Services (Study ID: STUDY00028894). I gained approval on August 3
\fs20 \super rd
\fs32 \nosupersub , 2015, and later submitted a modification that was also approved on October 15
\fs20 \super th
\fs32 \nosupersub , 2015. \'a0In this section, I address the three main ethical considerations outlined in the Belmont Report (1979). These three main principles are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Because participation in my interview was voluntary and informed, I did not interfere with the participant\'92s autonomy. The participant received basic information about the study and the interview prior to beginning the interview. I only used information to the capacity that the participant agreed to after I explained how I intended to address confidentiality. The participant had the ability to turn down the interview or ask that I do not use his/her results. In the case that a participant was unexpectedly incapacitated, disabled, or unable to exercise autonomy, I would also have ended and discarded the interview. Furthermore, the participant also had the freedom to request I not use any responses or parts of the interview. Though available, no participant in either sample exercised this option. I discussed these rights at the beginning of each interview and provided a sheet with the same information. (Appendix A). Prior to starting the interview, I read the consent form and confirmed that the participant consented.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 There was also no problem of beneficence in my study. The participants experienced neither bodily nor mental harm from speaking to me about their mentorship experiences. The main consideration in this aspect is protection of privacy of the participant. The participant\'92s identity remained concealed, except to myself. Throughout the study, all participants are referred to by their pseudonyms. Furthermore, all audio recordings of the interviews have been destroyed. It is my hope that the results of this study will only have positive societal effects that can lend towards improved mentorships and collaborative dynamics between genders.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The last ethical principle, justice, was also be observed in my study. This study had no direct effect on creating unequal benefits in society, although I aimed to better understand potential differences in mentorship relationships. Ultimately, I hope that my results will improve programs to provide appropriate support and mentorships. I merely investigated processes already in place through innocuous interviews. Time commitment was at most about an hour and there was negligible risk of harm.

\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I am studying the effect of gender on mentorship relationships from the perspective of the mentor in two different contexts. My first independent variable is the gender of the mentor: male or female. Although mentors brought up the gender of their mentee(s), I am focusing on the perspective of the mentor. Most mentors also drew from multiple mentorship experiences in their responses, but because I am interested in the mentor more than the mentee, each experience is relevant primarily in how it contributed to the mentor\'92s current behavior and attitudes. My dependent variables include motivations to mentor and expectations of the mentorship (responsibilities of the mentor and mentee, type of support offered, and challenges experienced as a mentor).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 I added a second independent variable to this study through comparing two different environments. The structure of the interview and the interview guides were the same for both the collegiate and workplace samples, lending to results that are comparable to each other. This format benefits a comparative analysis, because it is likely that students approach mentorship differently than entrepreneurs (Crips and Cruz 2009). Perhaps gender plays a larger role in mentorships in start-up companies, because there are higher stakes in investing career and psychosocial support towards mentees who may or may not reflect success back on the mentor. Perhaps expectations of the needs of mentees will be more dependent on gender in this context than in the college context. Perhaps those in a workplace environment understand mentorship as a whole to be different from how college students understand mentorship. These are questions I examined through my study.

\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 These are all aspects I addressed through specific questions in my interview guide, if the subjects did not come up organically. I first asked the participant to explain what the term mentorship means to them. The question is broad, and could reveal features that the participant finds important in mentorship relationships. I then compared responses to this question between participants, and used this question to orient the participant\'92s mind to reflect on mentorship. If the question was too broad, I then asked that the participant instead first answer, \'93In what capacities do you mentor?\'94 This helped the participant think of the different ways they mentor and the different mentorships they have been a part of. In most cases, as the participant answered this question, he began to describe his take on mentorship in his mentorship experiences.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 I then examined motivations to mentor by asking questions either directly about their motivations or inquiring into how the participants came to mentor another person. (See Appendix B 2-3). If the participant did not explicitly discuss whether or not he received mentorship in the past, I directly asked. Most participants seemed to agree that their prior experience with mentorship or their prior lack of mentorship has bearing on their activity in mentorship relationships now.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Next, I asked participants about their approaches towards and behaviors in mentorship relationships. I explored expectations of mentorship relationships through questions such as, \'93What do you think is important in being a good mentor?,\'94 \'93What are some responsibilities mentees have towards the mentorship?,\'94 and \'93Who is more responsible for initiating and maintaining communication?\'94 Because these responses demonstrated the mentor\'92s expectations of themselves and their mentees in the relationship, I believe that these responses also shed light on how the mentors behave towards mentees. I also asked \'93What are some of the challenges of being a mentor?\'94 to find out the different skills that male and female mentors struggle with. My last question, before asking specifically about gender-specific issues was, \'93Do you prefer formal or informal mentorship?\'94 Most participants indicate having been involved with both forms of mentorship. Perhaps preferences or aversions towards the structure of a formal mentorship compared to informal mentorship would also indicate mentor preferences. Ultimately however, the responses to this question did not become an important finding.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 My interview guide includes questions about gender-specific issues that participants may have encountered. I asked the participants if they believe there are problems or experiences in their environments that are specific to women, and then I ask the same about men. I also asked if the participant noticed anything different in the way he or she approaches mentoring mentees of different genders. Lastly, I asked if there are any other differences they\'92ve noticed about mentoring men as opposed to women. This last question aimed to catch any other distinctions between mentoring the two genders that the participant did not voice in previous questions (See Appendix B 10-12). This question also did not lead to an important finding.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 I started to close the interview by having participants think about if their mentorship experiences were what they expected and if they would participate in a program again. (See Appendix B 13-14). The very final closing question inquired if the participant thought I should have asked a question that I did not. This question was useful for improving my further interviews and it also drew opinions about mentorship that had not arisen prior in the interview. My opening question, \'93What does mentorship mean to you?\'94 in fact, was suggested to me by one of my interview participants.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I acquired both my samples through nonprobability sampling. Due to the time-intensive nature of interviews and the need for thoughtful participants, nonprobability sampling provided the most meaningful interviews to represent the most impactful mentors in both environments. It would be unlikely for me to garner the same amount of detail and honesty in random sampling methods.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Using a \'93mentor directory\'94 for MassChallenge, I contacted the first 48 entrepreneurs under forty years old whose \'a0names appeared in the directory list. I sent them basic information about my study and the length of the interview (See Appendix C). These interviews were chosen simply as they appeared randomly on several pages of this online directory. When an entrepreneur agreed to participate, we scheduled a time and location for us to meet and conduct the interview. Typically, we met in an office or conference room, but occasionally a bakery or caf\'e9. These interviews were confidential, and I was sure to emphasize the participant\'92s rights to omit information or stop the interview (See Appendix A). I explained the confidentiality of the interview carefully in the initial recruitment email and at the beginning of the interview. Each participant received a pseudonym, and only I have record of the identity of the participant in each interview. For this sample, I also incentivized participants with a $20 Amazon gift card.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 For the student sample, I personally contacted students by e-mail and provided them with the same basic information that I gave the entrepreneurs (See Appendix D). I then scheduled a mutually convenient time and location for each interview with students, typically using a private study room in Baker-Berry Library. At the start of the interview, I read students the information on the confidentiality of the interview (See Appendix B), making sure to obtain their consent to proceed. Each student subsequently received a pseudonym for their confidentiality. In the college sample, I incentivized participants with a King Arthur Flour item of their choice, such as coffee or a baked good.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 My project consists of two samples, one of entrepreneurs and one of college students. The prior sample consists of 15 participants and the latter sample consists of 13 participants, all of whom I acquired through nonprobability sampling methods. The advantage of non-probability sampling is that participants in my study were more likely to be interested and invested in my study, and provide thoughtful responses. The risk of non-probability sampling lies in a lower generalizability. The sample I chose risks being unrepresentative of its population, because all participants volunteered to be part of the study. All in all though, I am less interested in generalizing mentorship experiences of college and entrepreneurial populations, and more interested in gaining detailed and novel information from mentors. That my participants might not include those with weaker opinions towards mentorship does not detract from my goals either. Both settings offer many opportunities and avenues for mentorship; it is helpful to interview and learn from the most active and dedicated mentors, who are making the greatest impact on the community\'92s mentorship relationships.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 There is also the concern of incorporating outlier opinions in my results. I believe that through the in-depth nature of my interviews, the number of interviews I conducted, and careful, systematic analysis of the interviews, I was able to pick out any glaring features that uniquely influenced a participant\'92s responses. My knowledge of prior studies and literature about mentorship, combined with detailed 10+ interviews also caused outliers to stand out, which I noted.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In the summer of 2015, I sampled my entrepreneurial group in the Boston-Cambridge area by using convenience sampling. This sampling method helped me obtain interested participants, but also omits the opinions of mentors who are not interested in being studied. I interviewed 15 entrepreneurs, all of who were formal mentors under 40 years old in a large business accelerator in Boston. The business accelerator program is called MassChallenge, and it is a startup accelerator that selects 128 early-stage startups as finalists in a four-month program that provides media, marketing, and funding resources, experienced business mentors, and office space. The Boston area itself has a rich entrepreneurial community comprising of hundreds of start-up companies, and the program also includes several international companies. I interviewed a diverse array of mentors in the entrepreneurial space. The mentors that participated in my study are all young individuals that manage their own companies, but also act as mentors to at least one startup in the MassChallenge program. Most participants however, also mentor in many capacities through other programs, with other companies, and within their own companies. The mentors and mentees select each other for the mentorship relationship, and though the mentees receive guidelines and recommendations for how to manage the relationship, there are no requirements for how they must proceed in the relationship. Like Dartmouth students, the mentors come from diverse walks of life involving medicine, law, and/or business. Both settings comprise a diverse array of individuals with different interests and backgrounds, and like MassChallenge, Dartmouth is an environment that educates and provides resources to its admitted members.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016, I sampled my college student group through convenience sampling (6 participants) and snowball sampling (6 participants). I reached out to two programs: the First Year Peer Mentors Program (FYPM) and the Undergraduate Advisor Program (UGA). FYPM is a student-run program that matches sophomore, juniors, and seniors with freshmen that choose to have a mentor when they arrive at Dartmouth. The mentors receive basic training at the beginning of the year on how to support their mentees or respond if their mentees are in danger. This training includes a 4-hour mandatory session that provides information on the resources available for sexual assault and recommendations on how to give general support and listen. After training, the program allows the students to manage the relationships however they choose. There are opportunities for mentees to participate in activities or learn about resources, though none are mandatory.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The UGA program is another large, long-standing mentorship program at Dartmouth. UGAs are sophomores, juniors, or seniors, selected to manage, support, and foster community among a floor of residents at Dartmouth. I am particularly interested in upperclassmen UGAs for floors comprised entirely of freshmen. The Dartmouth Office of Residential Life outlines six primary areas of responsibilities for UGAs: (1) Promote and support the health wellness and safety of residents; (2) Facilitate the development of a sense of community; (3) Develop individual relationships with residents; (4) Be a productive member of the staff team; (5) Foster integrative learning and development among residents; (6) Develop and demonstrate leadership and professional skills. UGAs have more active responsibilities towards freshmen residents than FYPM\'92s do, and they receive more intensive training and continuing education. While the UGA program is programmatically more demanding that FYPM\'92s, the mentors of both programs mentor in more than one capacity, and speak from their experience and attitudes towards mentoring in general. Since participation in my study was voluntary, all the participants I interviewed were active and thoughtful mentors regardless of the programs they participated in. Furthermore, there were many similarities between responses from participants I found through the FYPM and UGA programs.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Both the entrepreneurial sample and the college sample contain mentors who mentor in many different capacities in environments where close collaborative work predominates over hierarchal organizational interactions. I also chose a work environment that frequently contains young people, making the work sample as comparable as possible to the college sample. Dartmouth is a school with young and diverse individuals, many of whom will pursue careers in business, entrepreneurship, and other technical or prestigious fields that are typically male-dominated. My two samples shed light on how students approach and behave in mentorships in college as opposed to in workspaces.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Following transcription of the interviews, I analyzed the data using Atlas.ti, a qualitative data analysis software. Dartmouth owns key-served versions, and I borrowed one of the licenses temporarily for analysis. Using Atlas.ti, I coded my data with themes and concepts within the focus of my project. There were several deductive codes that I anticipated from my methodology and research question. These included \'93Key Features of Mentorship,\'94 \'93Motivations,\'94 \'93Good Mentor/Bad Mentor,\'94 \'93Responsibilities of Mentee,\'94 \'93Frequency of Communication,\'94 and \'93Challenges of Mentorship.\'94 When I asked mentors about gender-specific experiences or issues their mentees have encountered, I anticipated certain responses, such as \'93Predominantly Male Environment,\'94 \'93Sexualization,\'94 \'93Androgyny,\'94 \'93Women Supporting Women,\'94 \'93Confidence, \'93Networking,\'94 and \'93Gender Roles.\'94 Some of these codes, such as \'93Confidence\'94 and \'93Gender Roles\'94 became important results, but others however, were not incorporated into later results chapters. Many patterns also arose inductively.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Over the course of interviewing and coding, certain concepts arose in conversations with multiple participants, and consequently became codes for several quotes in my interviews. In the entrepreneurial sample, concepts of \'93Distrust,\'94 \'93Respect/Credibility,\'94 \'93Glass Ceiling,\'94 \'93Interpersonal Skills,\'94 \'93Microaggressions,\'94 \'93Being Dodgy,\'94 and even \'93No Specific Female Issues\'94 and \'93No Specific Male Issues\'94 reoccurred in several interviews. These codes were important in increasing understanding of gender dynamics in the workplace setting, but I do not explicitly discuss them in the results chapters.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Like in the entrepreneurial sample, in the college student sample, I anticipated codes such as \'93Gender Roles,\'94 \'93Sexualization,\'94 and \'93Confidence.\'94 I also tagged quotes from the college sample interviews with codes I had used inductively in the entrepreneurial sample: \'93Asking for Help,\'94 \'93No Specific Female Issues,\'94 and \'93No Specific Male Issues.\'94 Unique inductive codes for the college sample included: \'93Talking about Emotions,\'94 \'93Safety Concerns, Protective,\'94 \'93Masculinity and Machismo,\'94 and \'93Navigating Social Scene.\'94 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Additionally, I maintained extensive memos summarizing unique aspects of each interview, as well as responses categorized under \'93motivations,\'94 \'93responsibilities,\'94 and \'93challenges.\'94 These supplemented the transcription of my interviews as well as my own memory of the interview and context of the interview.\page

\f0\b\fs32 \cf2 Gender Status Beliefs of Mentors at Dartmouth
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In this chapter, I focus on the responses of my participants in the collegiate sample, regarding their motivations, expectations, and behaviors as mentors. Despite the dearth of literature about gender and peer mentorship in collegiate environments, my results demonstrate that status beliefs about gender persist in college mentorships. Prior inequalities and applications of theory have focused on the workplace. As expected by the status beliefs associated with gender, women and men mentor differently even in the college setting. Ultimately, I find that mentors in college tend to describe their motivations, approaches to communication, types of conferred support, and encountered challenges in categorical types that are consistent with implications of gender status characteristics. While my sample size and data collection method do not permit statistical significance, definitive connections emerged between mentor motivations, expectations, and behaviors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Still, gender does not lock mentors into particular behaviors. In fact, the results show cases in which men and women mentors support types of mentorship more commonly described by mentors of the opposite sex. I believe this is due to the unique combination of experience, personality, and status characteristics that each person embodies. These components do not necessarily all lead to the same effect in every person; ergo, the gender of the mentor cannot be 100% predictive. Furthermore, the results of this section demonstrate that gender may not be as salient a status characteristic in college as it is in the workplace, which attenuates some of the expected effects of gender in this setting. Yet, as a whole, I did find a gender gap in the motivations, expectations, and behaviors of Dartmouth College student mentors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In a college sample, I identify particular groupings of mentor expectations and behaviors generally consistent with the mentor\'92s gender. There was a general gender gap in which mentors who lacked sufficient mentorship themselves endorsed to more mentor-proactive styles of communication and showed lower confidence in themselves as mentors. These were typically women mentors. On the other hand, mentors who were satisfied with the mentorship they received early in college often believed in a more balanced style of mentorship, in which the mentee had active responsibilities to the mentor. Along with more demanding expectations of the mentee, these mentors, usually men, also expressed higher confidence in themselves as mentors. Men and women in this setting both believed that providing psychosocial support was most important, but men often stressed technical support as well. Men more frequently discussed the importance of providing instrumental support generally and described themselves personally providing this instrumental support. In the subsequent subsections, I describe how these patterns manifest themselves in my results. I discuss the motivations, communicative approaches, types of support conferred, and self-confidence concerns that men and women in this sample had.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Motivations underlie and influence the mentorship that mentors provide. To understand the motivations of mentors, I very simply asked them what motivates them to mentor. While each person had a slightly different narrative to explain their reasons for mentoring, two main motivations emerged. Among college students, mentors were motivated by either a lack of received mentorship earlier at Dartmouth, or a sense of duty or reciprocity to provide as satisfying support as they once received at Dartmouth. When mentors felt motivated by lack of support, they cited this as the predominant reason for becoming a mentor themselves. This is not to say that they felt no other motivations, but those who lacked mentorship spoke immediately with the greatest detail about this motivation, and sometimes cited no other motivations. Mentors who had received mentorship gave other motivations that corresponded to Beltman and Schaben\'92s (2012) categorization of mentorship benefits to mentors in Table 1. The mentors who lacked mentorship emphasized that insufficiency as their predominant motivation and were more commonly female, while those that received mentorship and described additional motivations were typically male.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I found that 4 of 5 women I spoke with expressed that they lacked mentorship during their freshmen year at Dartmouth. For example, though Amanda reached out for help to her First Year Peer Mentor (FYPM), she felt that her mentor was unresponsive and uninterested. Amanda explained the causation between her disappointing experience as a mentee and her motivation to mentor when she said, \'93It was sort of something that was helping her get a line on her resume that was like, \'93PEER MENTOR\'85yea that\'92s definitely something I would have liked to have had freshman year and so I want to provide that for other people.\'94 Similarly, as a freshman, Jane had hoped to find community and support from her freshman floor, but instead, despised living on the floor she was placed. After being placed in an undesired housing situation with no roommates, she said, \'93the combination of not having that kind of a support system and also just being on a floor that was very divided from the get-go\'85I just knew that I never wanted other people to have to deal.\'94 Her feeling of being unsupported also directly led to her commitment to mentorship as a freshman undergraduate advisor (UGA), First Year Peer Mentor, and upperclassmen in her organizations. While this rhetoric was strongest among 4 of the 5 women in my sample, it is not exclusive to nor guaranteed to be a female experience and motivation.

\f0\fs32 In his interview, Mark described a motivation to mentor that was very similar to that of Amanda and Jane.

So I came in and all of the resources that were provided almost you know, without exception failed\'85they provided very poor\'85there was very poor information. People were unwilling to work with me, and so I didn\'92t want other students to encounter the same difficulties that I had.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 His account of struggle demonstrates that both men and women can lack support and mentorship, and insufficient social support can be a strong motivator to provide mentorship to others. Even though workplace literature suggests that men oftentimes receive satisfactory mentorship and have access to greater social capital than women, this pattern is not infallible in the college setting (Lin 2000). Like Amanda, Sally, Christie, and Jane, Mark tied his lack of prior mentorship to his motivation to be a mentor. Most men mentors tied their satisfaction with prior mentorship to their motivations to mentor.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Mentors who spoke positively of the mentorship they received all described additional motivations. With the exception of Mark, the other 7 men mentors in this sample were quite satisfied with the mentorship they received early on at Dartmouth. Additionally, one female, Alice, also felt that she had a very caring and attentive FYPM, and was very satisfied with the help that she received from her freshman UGA. Their motivations fell within Beltman and Schaben\'92s (2012) mentor benefit categories: altruistic, cognitive, social, and personal growth, shown in Table 1. For example, Joe and Curtis both brought up altruistic mentor benefits when they described their love of helping people grow and they desire to improve lives. Alice, who felt well-supported by her mentors, also mentioned altruism as a reason for her active mentor role in FYPM. Similarly, Paul stressed an altruistic reward in mentoring another individual when he said:

\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Some mentors discussed more than one mentor benefit when they cited their motivations. Bobby described social, cognitive, and personal development benefits to mentoring when he said:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 It\'92s pragmatically a good idea to help people, because maybe one day you\'92ll need assistance from them. And\'85I kind of like doing it. It\'92s a social activity. It\'92s a fun activity. You can learn a lot about the person you\'92re helping and they can teach you a lot about yourself or something else in the world.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Though men mentors cited a range of mentor benefits as motivations for mentoring, there was consistency in that all men mentors cited at least one of the four mentor benefits in Table 1.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The gender gap in prior mentorship I found among college students resembles that found in research focusing on the workplace. Previous studies of the workplace have already found that women in the workplace receive less mentorship than men, and when women do receive mentorship, they still secure fewer benefits in the form of promotion and earnings (Kay and Wallace 2009). This is consistent with status beliefs about women\'92s competencies in the workplace, which would lead to less interest in investing mentorship in women (Correll and Ridgeway 2003; McGuire 2002). While promotions and earnings are not good measures of mentorship outcomes in college settings, it seems that college women still experience more dissatisfaction about mentorships than college men.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Gender differences in motivations for becoming a mentor stem from differences in amount and/or quality of mentorship that mentors received earlier on in college. Should this be true, in reverse scenarios, in which women receive satisfactory mentorship, women should describe motivations more consistent with men (Wagner and Berger 1997). This is exactly the case of Alice, a female participant who felt well-cared for as a mentee. Women can and do have positive experiences as mentees in college, but they are less likely to receive satisfactory mentorship, and therefore are more likely to be motivated by a lack of mentorship. The gender gap in prior mentorship also has implications on other mentor behaviors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The mentor motivations discussed here align with mentor expectations and behaviors in mentorship relationships. The type of communication to which mentors prescribe corresponds to the motivations for mentoring discussed earlier in this section. The degree of proactivity and leadership mentors show in their communication styles stems largely from their motivations to mentor and corresponds to what status beliefs about gender would predict. Consequently, there is also a general trend between a mentor\'92s gender and his or her approach to communication.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I identified three approaches to communication in the course of interviewing both my samples. These three types, which I define in Table 2, progress from the most proactive mentor model to the least proactive mentor model and from the least proactive mentee model to the most proactive mentee model. In my study, I found that assertiveness and distribution of responsibility between mentor and mentee varied in ways that were consistent with gender expectations of leadership and the salience of gender in the two contexts. While participants in the workplace sample support either Type II or Type III communication models, mentors from the collegiate sample support either Type I or Type II communication models. In both samples, women mentors tended to believe more in the higher mentor-proactivity option of the two types in their respective settings. In the next chapter, I will explain workplace sample patterns of communication. First, I focus on how these models manifest along gender lines in the collegiate sample.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Based on status beliefs about gender, I anticipated men and women to have different expectations of their own responsibilities and their mentee\'92s responsibilities to the mentorship relationship. In both gender-neutral and masculine-type tasks, the performance expectation for men is higher than that for women (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Even in a gender-neutral task, men should have an advantage over women in participation, influence, and confidence. The more autocratic and confident leadership style of men compared to women (Eagly, Makhijani, and Konsky 1999) manifested in participant responses about communicative styles of mentoring and expectations of their mentees. A diffuse status characteristic with associated status beliefs, such as gender, can shape behavioral interchange patterns between mentors and mentees, and thus propagate the status beliefs (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Gender discrepancies between college mentor communicative styles correlates with status beliefs of gender.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The same four women who were dissatisfied with the mentorship they received at Dartmouth also asserted that a trademark of a good mentor was proactivity. Amanda acknowledged that the mentee has some part of building the relationship when she said, \'93I really think a mentor should go like three-quarters the way there and the mentee the other quarter;\'94 yet, she still clearly endorses strongly to a Type I model of communication, in her assessment that: \'93being a mentor is sort of like being a friend but being always the friend who checks in\'85 it's like being in a friendship that you really, really want to maintain.\'94 When I asked the other women with whom the burden of communication fell, the other four women who endorsed the Type I model agreed that being a mentor was an active, voluntary responsibility that they took on, especially in a formal program in which one\'92s role as a mentor is defined. Jane justified the Type I attitude when she said that \'93it's so much harder [to ask for help] when you are a mentee, because you're just looking for direction, and it's a lot harder to ask, I think, for help than it is to offer help.\'94 These women who did not receive satisfactory mentorship earlier at Dartmouth seem to believe that as mentors, they should embody as much proactivity as their own mentors lacked. Aside from the status beliefs associated with their gender, their prior experiences also affect their communicative style. These mentors do not want younger students to experience the disappointments that they did and subsequently take it upon themselves to give that support unconditionally. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 When I asked male participants where the burden of communication lied, most male participants spoke about how the mentee needed to take initiative, and these participants de-emphasized the mentor role. They often de-emphasized by assigning higher proactivity to the mentor conditionally. This is consistent with the Type II model. These mentors also described a more equal input from both sides of the relationship. In Curtis\'92 words, \'93In a mentorship relationship, the, the word \'91relationship\'92 is implicit in a mentorship\'85 so [communication] does certainly go both ways.\'94 Some Type II mentors, such as Bobby, even thought that communication should lie more heavily on the mentee side: 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 When I think about it logically, it's equally on both, but when I think about it in my own experience in life it's more the mentee, the person being mentored, because they are the ones who are receiving the service more-so.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Prior workplace literature postulating that men have a more domineering leadership style (Ridgeway 2001) aligns with this study\'92s findings. When in positions of high status, men lead more authoritatively than women do with better response than women receive (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). The trend in this sample is that men take on more authoritative positions as mentors than their female counterparts. While in the college setting, men mentors still supported some balance of responsibilities of both the mentor and mentee, a Type II mentorship preference definitely reflected higher demands on mentees than a Type I mentorship preference did. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Some mentors specified that they would only be proactive in certain conditions, and the most common condition was a formal mentorship program. Men mentors that described this condition included Curtis, Connor, and Kevin. After describing the appropriate equality in mentorship relationships, even Curtis then admitted that as a UGA, he shifted the burden of initiating and maintaining communication more onto himself. In a formal program, they see their mentor role more as a job to fulfill, and are more likely to check in with their mentees.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 However, in their explanations of communicative balance, these mentors also explained that there is only so much they are responsible for, and only so much they can do without an active mentee. While Type I mentors believe that the mentee is responsible for merely being responsive and open-minded to the mentor, Type II mentors believe that mentees have more active duties to mentorship relationships and must demonstrate some deference to the mentor. Rather than just being responsible for interacting with mentors, mentees, by Type II definition, are responsible for reaching out for help, doing work, reflecting, and producing feedback to the mentor. Connor verbalized the necessity for a mentee to reach out when he said:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 It\'92s also a responsibility, for example, if you have a mentor, to communicate to them when you\'92re feeling uncomfortable or when you\'92re feeling confused, because otherwise they don\'92t know\'85.as a mentor, you don\'92t necessarily know when somebody\'92s having a problem. So it\'92s their responsibility to communicate that to you.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Connor also gave an example in which he felt he performed his duties sufficiently as a UGA to periodically check in on his residents; however, when one of his residents academically failed a term, the outcome was out of his control.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I'm a UGA, I'm there to help somebody. I had this kid that I knew pretty well and I talked to quite a bit, but it turns out he just like failed all of his classes, and I had no idea that that was happening, and nobody told me that was happening. Nobody told me he wasn't studying, nobody told me he wasn't going to class, and I didn't notice, and he didn't tell me, and he seemed perfectly fine and happy all the time. And then he got in trouble and had to take an off term and everything. And if he had told me this shit near the beginning, I could've helped him out.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Connor\'92s frustration with and disappointment towards his mentee\'92s shortcomings shows clear adherence to a Type II communication model. Though recognizing his own responsibility to be there as help, the burden of communication is more the mentee than himself. It was the mentee\'92s responsibility to make his problems clear to the mentor.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Type II mentors believe that mentees should not only reach out for help, but also that mentees must actively do work, reflect, and produce feedback when the mentor delivered help. Bobby provided an example of tutoring, in which he felt it was appropriate for the mentor to have some sort of lesson plan prepared, but also asserted that the \'93mentee has to listen to it, be active in it, and want to learn from it and put in work to it as well.\'94 Jacob corroborated this opinion when he said, \'93I think the most important thing on the mentee's part is genuine effort and willingness to put that effort to improve themselves.\'94 Curtis also spoke directly about the importance of self-reflection and respect for the mentor on the mentee\'92s part:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 They need to spend some time outside of time with their mentor to think about what was said, and I think that's very important because, like I said, the point of a mentoring relationship is to help the other person grow and in order to process the, the, the feedback, the wisdom of the mentor, there has to be some reflective time that happens on their own, individually, to process all of that.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 These assertions about the mentee\'92s need to work, reflect, and provide feedback were absent in the narratives of Type I mentors. Instead, the women who believed in Type I mentorship felt that mentorship should be a proactive experience from the mentor side. While the male and female differences in communicative approach may be somewhat explained by the gender gap in prior mentorship experiences, this only accounts for why women feel compelled to be highly proactive, not why men believe mentors should have higher demands of mentees.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	It is likely that status beliefs about male and female leadership influence the communicative approach of mentors, and through behavioral interchange patterns with mentees, these patterns reinforce the expectations. When two parties interact, and one party demonstrates assertive, high status behavior and the other demonstrates deference, the interaction can lead to shared beliefs about typical behaviors of both parties. As women mentors continue assert less authority than men in their interchanges with mentees, these interchanges further legitimize gender expectations. In an unfortunate cycle, the different expectations of men and women legitimize higher demands from men mentors and resist issuance of responsibilities from women mentors. Correll and Ridgeway (2003) assert that gender has been documented as extremely important in the legitimacy of individuals to occupy valued status positions and assert directive authority. Even though both the men and women mentors share the same position of \'93mentor,\'94 men are more comfortable holding expectations of mentees than women are, because even in the college setting, men might have more legitimacy in a leadership position. The results from the college sample support the idea of legitimacy, though not entirely.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Despite prior mentorship experiences and status beliefs surrounding male and female leadership, it is not possible to entirely predict a college individual\'92s communication style. Diffuse status characteristics such as gender are very influential, but every individual contains a different combination of both diffuse and specific status characteristics. Joe\'92s interview diverged from those of all the other male college participants, because he was satisfied with the mentorship he received as a freshman, but believed squarely that the burden of communication lies with the mentor. He justified this view very sympathetically:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Certainly they are the ones who are probably more experienced, more knowledgeable, possibly older although I guess that's not really a pre-requisite. And just more knowledgeable in general about what is going on. Probably the mentors have volunteered for this position, have been selected for some reason. So they're probably they they're they're more responsible for the relationship I'd definitely say.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Realistically, an individual\'92s unique combination of experiences and characteristics can offset the status beliefs associated with gender. Some men, despite receiving satisfactory mentorship early on, feel a stronger urge to take responsibility of the relationship than other men with similar experiences do. In most cases, prior mentorship experiences and status beliefs should be predictive of a more proactive or less proactive communicative approach to mentoring. It is also clear though, that the two do not necessarily produce the same effect.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The only female to assert that mentees have a responsibility to direct the relationship was Alice. Once again, her responses aligned more with those of men mentors at Dartmouth. Alice felt that the mentor should only be more proactive at the beginning of the relationship, then \'93once you\'92ve established a relationship, it can be more equal.\'94 While she agreed with Jane that it\'92s hard for mentees to feel comfortable reaching out to their mentors, she overall demonstrates a Type II model of communication when she expressed that after she has made herself available or contacted her mentees, \'93it\'92s on them to reciprocate and make use of [the] relationship,\'94 and that if her mentees don\'92t reach out to her, \'93they\'92re not taking advantage of [her] as a resource or fostering the relationship.\'94 Therefore, ultimately, her rhetoric describes that mentees must actively direct the relationship.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Alice\'92s prescription to the Type II mentorship, which is dissimilar from the other women I interviewed, but similar with the majority of men I interviewed, coincides with her motivation for mentoring. Because she is satisfied with the mentorship she received as a freshman, she does not feel compelled to take as full responsibility for communication as Type I mentors do. Even though gender is a diffuse status characteristic, it is possible that Alice had specific status characteristics that impacted her view of her own competencies, and stemmed from her prior mentorship relationships. The positive specific status characteristics she views in herself causes her to take on the same view as a majority of men mentors, who felt satisfied with the mentorship they received, and believed in more reciprocity and mentee responsibility.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Ultimately, gender discrepancies in mentor motivations and status beliefs about gender have important implications on mentor behavior and expectations. Based on the lack of support women felt earlier on at Dartmouth and their lesser legitimacy in high status leadership positions, male and women mentors have different expectations of their own proactivity and their mentee\'92s proactivity. Another important aspect of mentorship conferred by mentors is the balance of technical and psychosocial support. The next section investigates that aspect of mentor expectations/behaviors.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The relationship between gender and type of support conferred persists in the college setting, though the relationship is attenuated. Previous work, including that by Smith-Jentsch (2004), defines two functions of mentorship for the mentee: psychosocial support and career development. Some refer to career development as instrumental support, which encompasses technical skill enhancement, increased professional contacts, and advice on a professional path (Davidson and Foster-Johnson 2001). Because performance expectations are higher for women than men in socioemotional tasks, women should confer more psychosocial support than men (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). However, in my study it was clear that both college-age men and women stressed the importance of providing psychosocial support, more so than instrumental support. All mentors believed that psychosocial support was a key feature of good mentors. Consistent with performance expectations for men however, men were still more inclined than women to see themselves as resources for technical skill than women were. All mentors believed that psychosocial support was a key feature of good mentors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 There was a repetitiveness in the psychosocial qualities that mentors ascribed to good mentorship. Mentors most often mentioned the essentiality of being a good listener and being nonjudgmental. Some mentors, such as Christie, who said that \'93probably the most important, uh, part of being a good mentor is the ability to listen without judgment,\'94 believed the two qualities were important in conjunction. Both men and women mentors also stated that empathy was key to being an effective mentor. Some mentors, such as Joe, described empathy rather than stating it outright. When he responded to \'93What is important in being a good mentor?\'94 with \'93This sounds totally clich\'e9, but the ability to, um, to put yourself into the other person's shoes and truly think about an an idea or a problem how they think about it,\'94 he essentially described empathy. While there was repetition in the mentor\'92s opinions of good mentor qualities, many mentors seemed to believe that a more general emotional competency was key.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Most mentors described several psychosocial qualities, while others realized that rather than having 
\i individual
\i0  psychosocial qualities, mentors should exhibit a 
\i general
\i0  \'93emotional accuracy,\'94 as Curtis called it, or \'93emotional understanding,\'94 as Christie called it. Curtis described general success and knowledge of how to give emotional support when he said:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 I think the qualities that a mentor should have are the same qualities that a good friend should have, and so for me, these are the qualities of emotional intelligence, of accurate empathy and compassion, and, um, and active listening\'85 it's important for me at least that a mentor is not authoritarian, is not judgmental. It's kind of this nonjudgmental, non-confrontational... it's somebody who can create a space to give constructive feedback and also create a space of ... a space conducive for reflection with the goal of self-improvement. Um, and so I see all of that done in a framework of, of emotional intelligence and accurate empathy.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The emphasis that many mentors placed on successfully providing overall emotional support demonstrates the significance that college-age mentors place on psychosocial support. This importance traverses the gender of the mentor. Though status characteristics theory suggests that the mentors\'92 genders would affect the mentorship that they provide, this was not always the case in the college sample (Ridgeway 2001). Traditional gender roles suggest that women mentors give more psychosocial support than their male counterparts; however, there is no perceivable difference in the college sample. Gender expectations also anticipate that men are more inclined to provide instrumental support. In the workplace, this is because men tend to be in more senior positions than women (Eagly, Makhijani, and Klonsky 1992). Though men and women mentors at Dartmouth had equal seniority with their positions as mentors, men still provided more instrumental support. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	While both men and women mentors in college believed that psychosocial support was important, college males were more likely to give instrumental support. Two men mentors believed that the ability to provide instrumental support was key to being a good mentor. According to Kevin, a good mentor must be able to click with their mentee. However, he based the ability of mentors to click with their mentees on academic and career experience: 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li746\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 For me, I could be a chemistry major and have a mentor in a completely different field that's not even STEM related, but I don't know if that would ... It might make a good mentor, it might not, and that's just based off of the experience that the mentor had, you know? Like, the mentor may have a PhD, but if I want a PhD in chemistry and the mentor has a PhD in classics or something, it's like, well they don't really match up that well.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In Kevin\'92s interview, he often described examples in which either his mentor helped advance his academic and career interests or he helped advance another individual\'92s academic and career interests. This is consistent with prior work that states that men provide more instrumental support than women do (Scandura and Rains 1993). I observed that men saw themselves more as instrumental resources even when they did not explicitly characterize a good mentor as one who conferred instrumental support.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	Even when mentors did not speak directly about the importance of providing technical support, instrumental support was much more prevalent in their understandings of mentorship. While only two men mentors spoke directly about the importance of providing instrumental support, another two largely framed their understandings of mentorship in circumstances that conferred academic and technical help. I originally contacted both Paul and Bobby because they were freshmen UGAs as well as mentors in other capacities. However, over the course of the interview, they oftentimes referred to mentorship as a tutoring situation. For example, when I asked Bobby for a challenge of being a mentor, he said, \'93if they show up the day before a quiz and expect you to just teach them everything right then and there that they didn't learn in the classroom, that can be a problem,\'94 showing that he views mentorship relationships often in the context of academic support. No women in this sample spoke about tutoring, teaching, or any role in which they provided technical or instrumental support.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	While the stronger male emphasis on instrumental support is consistent with prior findings of mentorship in the workplace, the equal emphasis on psychosocial support is not expected from prior research (Scandura and Ragins 1993). Application of gender expectations to mentorship relationships suggest that traditional gender roles will cause men and women to provide different balances of psychosocial and instrumental support (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). In this sample, we find this to be only half true. While college males are already more focused on providing instrumental support than college females, both college males and college females emphasized psychosocial support as highly important. This might be due to differences in the setting of workplace and collegiate environments.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	The college setting fosters a more equal expectation for male and female perceptions of self-status than the workplace setting does. The effect of a status characteristic, even one as diffuse and obvious as gender, relies on the context (Wagner and Berger 1997). In situations stereotypically attributed to men, men and women should have different expectations of themselves and each other; however, due to the dominant American cultural standard of men being more competent, even in neutral situations or for neutral tasks, the difference should still exist, though more subtly (Wagner and Berger 1997). In the workplace, men more typically occupy positions of higher power and prestige; the results of this study have largely supported this gender discrepancy at Dartmouth, but the even emphasis on psychosocial support between men and women suggests that perhaps, the college setting allows for gender to be less salient.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	Self-confidence, though a challenge for many mentors, presented different challenges for men and women. Upon asking mentors what were some challenges to being a mentor, certain responses such as time management and setting aside personal judgments occurred with similar frequency and emphasis between both genders. The question about challenges however, revealed three tiers of self-confidence mentors exhibited about their instrumental abilities in both the college and workplace sample. According to Table III, each tier represents a challenge with self-confidence that mentors experience. The tiers increase from lowest to highest self-confidence. Because men experience greater prestige and confidence in leadership positions, they should express greater self-confidence than women as mentors, especially about instrumental support (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). In the college sample, not all of the participants discussed self-confidence challenges; only three women and four men did so. However, it is worth noting that of those seven, women tended to demonstrate only Tier I self-confidence challenges, while men demonstrated Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III challenges usually in some combination of two of the three.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	The results of this study corroborate workplace findings that men demonstrate more assertion and confidence (Wagner and Berger 1997). College men also demonstrated more confidence in their interviews. With the exception of Alice once again, the only self-confidence challenges described by women mentors were concerns of not knowing the answer or lacking knowledge. Tier I self-confidence challenges convey the lowest level of self-confidence in one\'92s instrumental abilities. While only three women spoke about self-confidence at all, aside from Alice, the other two showed the lowest tier of confidence. For example, Amanda\'92s assertion is exemplary of that attitude: \'93it's always hard to say, \'91I don't know,\'92 to some degree but especially when you're supposed to be the person who knows all and to not be able say, \'91Oh, this is the right answer\'92 can be hard. Even in the college setting, women have lower confidence in their expertise than men do. 
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 On the other hand, college men are unlikely to demonstrate Tier I self-confidence exclusively. Even among the two men who expressed Tier I self-confidence challenges, only one expressed the Tier I challenge alone, while the other expressed Tier I and Tier II challenges. It was still more likely to see higher confidence in male than female college mentors. Jacob demonstrated a Tier III self-confidence challenge when he told me, \'93unless a person very specifically asks for it I will not accept the role of a mentor because I will worry about becoming condescending or patronizing.\'94 Curtis also felt challenged by overconfidence in what he termed, \'93the expert trap.\'94
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 This corresponds to prior research in the workplace, which asserts that men are expected to demonstrate more confidence, assertion, and influence than women (Ridgeway 2001). Based on expectation states theories, expectations can become self-fulfilling, and thus lead men to project confidence and assertion, and perpetuate the expectation. The confidence that men feel towards their greater perceived knowledge and oftentimes higher executive positions encourages continued confidence (Eagly, Makhijani, and Klonsky 1992). On the other hand, women do not experience the same performance expectations in the workplace. Some of the men in my sample even acknowledged the expectation of masculinity that they felt and the pressure to be confident in ways beyond instrumental expertise.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In my interviews, some men expressed discomfort towards \'93the kind of maintenance of masculinity\'94 that was expected of them. When I questioned some men about specific challenges they believed men in their environment faced, Joe described the pressure of masculinity when he said, \'93It is men not being able to show emotion and not being able to show fear. The transition to college is incredibly scary, but I think men are often told that they have to be stoic.\'94 Curtis felt similarly when he described all the different expectations of social success, academic success, and romantic success men were supposed to somehow achieve to be \'93the stereotypical man\'94 and \'93to be a man, man up.\'94 Joe and Curtis voiced that for them, the gender expectation they experienced to be more confident and influential was definitely at play and produced an appearance of assertiveness.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Both women and men mentors expressed that female mentees were much more likely to approach their mentors and express uncertainty. Mentors generally said that women felt more comfortable approaching their mentors about emotional problems, or simply expressing feelings of distress to their mentors. Men seemed to approach their mentors with more specific questions, whereas mentors felt as though women more often just wanted to talk their problems out. Even when Jacob admitted, \'93I felt like I could be closer to the males and be kind of more, you know, bro-y with them,\'94 he still said, \'93I definitely had more, more interactions with the female residents,\'94 and \'93I engaged more with women because the women were more proactive.\'94 While men experience the expectation to be more confident of themselves and more fearless, the opinions of both male and female Dartmouth mentors show that women do not have the same expectations to be confident. In this way, self-confidence, as well as motivations to mentor, balance of responsibility, and types of support provided, tend to be different between male and female college mentors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Even though the college environment has been of less interest in mentorship and gender research, these results suggest that the same patterns and gender implications in the workplace already begin to manifest at the undergraduate stage. Dartmouth women report less access to satisfactory mentorship than men do, and both genders behave according to the implications of their gender in several ways. While the importance of psychosocial support traverses gender, theory has already settled that not all status characteristics are equally salient in all circumstances. For example, status beliefs about women\'92s socioemotional focus may be less salient at Dartmouth than in prior workplace studies. Alice\'92s experiences as a mentee and opinions as a mentor further support that in different circumstances the implications of gender can even be reversed (Wagner and Berger 1997). Because of the importance of setting and scenario, we expect the results of the workplace sample to show some differences, but also similarities in the effects of gender status beliefs on motivations, expectations, and behaviors of mentors.\page

\f0\b\fs32 \cf2 Chapter 5: Gender Status Beliefs of Mentors in the Workplace
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In this chapter, I explain the results of my interviews with mentors in an entrepreneur sample. Building on prior work on gender in the workplace (Steele 2012), I place a unique emphasis on the mentor specifically and how the mentor\'92s gender impacts the mentor\'92s motivations and behavior in their mentorship relationships (Steele 2012). Based on status beliefs about women\'92s and men\'92s competencies, researchers would anticipate that men and women do not provide the same mentorship (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). My results show that this is in fact true. Gender disparities in motivations, approaches to communication, support conferred, and self-confidence manifest differently in the workplace than in the college setting, but ultimately still show gender differences. With a sample size of eight women and seven men in one type of workplace setting, it is hard to generalize how men and women in the workplace behave always. However, based on my findings in this setting, women are more driven to mentor by socioemotional reasons than men are and women provide mentorship with stronger psychosocial components than men do. Instead, men focus more on instrumental support than women, and some men will also assert more dominance over their mentee than women mentors would.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	These results are consistent with implications of status beliefs about gender. The associations society makes of different characteristics for men and women should manifest as actual differences in behavior of men and women. Gender status beliefs are particularly important in mixed gender environments and situations that demand leadership, such as mentorship. Even in gender-neutral tasks such as mentorship, performance expectations for men are higher than those for women, and we would expect men to act with greater confidence and dominance than women (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Furthermore, typical gender disparities in executive statuses of men and women cause higher expectations for men to give technical and career advice, while the socioemotional associations with women suggest that women give more emotional support (Eagly, Makhijani, and Klonsky 1992). Even in a relatively flat hierarchal organization that demanded a lot collaboration between actors, the entrepreneur workspace was still a space where status gender beliefs persist.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Motivations for mentors in the workplace differed from those of mentors at Dartmouth. While at Dartmouth, there was a sizable gender gap in prior experience being mentored, this was not the case in the entrepreneur sample of my study, as only two women expressed that they had lacked mentorship in their careers. Similar to women in the college sample, one of these two women also cited her lack of mentorship as her main reasons for mentoring, and gave no other primary motivations. To emphasize the ease of receiving mentorship in the workplace, one woman went so far as to say that \'93You\'92ll always be mentored by somebody, right?\'94 and another exclaimed that \'93I think everybody who\'92s in a professional environment has been mentored in some capacity or another.\'94 Therefore, a gender gap in prior experience does not underlie the gender differences in motivations in the entrepreneur sample; instead, in a sample in which both men and women received mentorship, the women drew on more socioemotional motivations than men did. This is likely due to the influence of gender expectations on women and role modeling of prior women mentors the participants once had.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 	Women cited altruistic reasons for mentoring far more often than men did. Ana, Annie, Ashley, and Cecilia all described the personal reward of helping others succeed. Ashley described the altruistic mentor benefit most emphatically when she said, \'93My goal in life is, I just love to help other people succeed. That's what I do and what I love, and so mentoring is just kind of like, a natural part, component of that.\'94 Cecilia, who described other mentor benefits, also mentioned altruism as one of her motivators to mentor: \'93It\'92s one, helping an individual that I see that could be successful that might need a little bit of guidance.\'94 Two men discussed motivations that I classified as altruistic. A male mentor, Bill, mentioned that he found satisfaction in helping others enjoy their work more and be better at their work; however, even in Bill\'92s case, his language was not as strong as that of the women who proclaimed to love helping people or whose goal in life was to help others. Another male mentor, Matt, spoke strongly about the meaningfulness of giving insight and support to others, but many of his responses in general tended towards a highly socioemotional mindset that set him apart from other male participants.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	The other mentor benefits (cognitive, social growth, and personal development) that appeared in the narratives of college mentors, did not appear in the same way in the narratives of workplace mentors. Both women and men cited cognitive benefits as a reason for mentoring. Cecilia spoke about cognitive benefits when she said, \'93I kind of wanted to learn more about other start-ups in the industry, in Boston and New York and one of the people mentoring in San Francisco. I love learning about new companies, new ideas, it's also something that I know I could never do.\'94 Ashley also felt similarly when she said, \'93As much as I'm educating, I'm also learning, myself.\'94 Julian also believed that mentors gained experience and knowledge from their mentees. His statement that mentoring keeps him \'93nimble is the word. Nimble is the word. As you become more and more experienced you have less opportunities to shift\'85. keeps you better at what you already do because you don't become biased,\'94 shows that he is motivated by a desire to acquire knowledge. Unlike the cognitive benefit, interestingly, the social mentor benefit was distinctly gendered in this setting.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	One of Beltman and Schaber\'92s (2012) mentor benefits, the social benefit, appeared occasionally as a motivation to mentor for women, but never for men. The social mentor benefit includes the expansion of one\'92s social network, along with coordinating mentees with other people and developing friendships and interactions with mentees. According to Ana, one of the reasons she mentors other entrepreneurs is that:

\pard\pardeftab720\li746\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 It\'92s just a really fun way of keeping my finger on the pulse of what\'92s happening, and also being able to connect new rising companies or new entrepreneurs with people who are already working in that field or related fields or complementary fields. So I can connect them to increase or amplify what they\'92re both doing, just by bringing them together.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Ashley also admitted that \'93networking is a big huge part of [mentoring].\'94 Other women described the social benefit of mentoring as a means of career advancement. Cecilia said that she \'93wanted to get involved with more things in the Boston community and I was looking for, you know, to expand [her] own network as well, both with start-ups as well as with other mentors.\'94 That women were more interested in expanding their social and professional network fits within the expectation that women have more socioemotional competency than men (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). When women seek instrumental ends, they still find means that fit with gender expectations. According to past research, men still have larger social networks that include more access to professional information, business opportunities, and professional achievement (Lin 2000). However, the results of this section show that despite having less social capital, women apply status beliefs about their socioemotional competencies to improving their social networks. Men, on the other hand, see mentoring more as a reciprocal, natural duty to the professional field.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 	The male mentors in this sample more frequently spoke about the importance of \'93paying it forward\'94 in society. Though this was not one of Beltman and Schaeben\'92s (2012) mentor benefit categories, it arose as a common explanation among men for engaging in mentorship relationships. \'a0Matt, Tony and Daniel all expressed that because they had received help in the past, it was part of their duty to give help to others. Julian widened the concept of \'93paying it forward\'94 to society when he said that \'93If it's within your ability without hurting yourself, if you can help someone else succeed, you're actually helping yourself because you're helping society succeed.\'94 Stephanie was the sole woman who mentioned that providing mentorship is part of the duties of a pay-it-forward attitude. Overall however, four of the six men I interviewed felt a sense of societal responsibility to provide mentorship, while women tended to be motivated by altruistic and social benefits. This discrepancy likely did not appear in the college sample, because the gender gap in prior mentorship experiences was an overwhelming motivator for those who did not receive mentorship. However, in the workplace sample, it seems that women are more motivated by socioemotional reasons, while men are more motivated by a sense of duty towards society.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In the entrepreneur setting, men were still more likely to support a more autocratic and confident leadership style than women were. As shown in Table 4, in the college sample, Type I and Type II communicative models were at play, but in entrepreneur sample, Type II and Type III communicative models dominated mentor communicative styles. Like in the college sample, in the entrepreneur sample, male mentors more often supported a communicative type that ascribed higher responsibility to the mentee. In the workplace, not a single woman of the eight female mentors and not a single man of the seven male mentors in the sample believed that mentors were entirely responsible for being proactive. Despite the different context though, the results are still in line with status beliefs about gender. Though men and women both supported Type II communicative models, only male participants supported also supported a Type III communicative model. In other words, whether it was a college or workplace setting, men were more likely to lead authoritatively and hold higher expectations of deference for mentees.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Female mentors in this sample all described a Type II approach to communicating with their mentees. According to Cecilia, the mentee must reach out, because \'93a mentor is not a babysitter, it's not a teacher, it's not a parent.\'94 She shared the perspective of other women in the workplace sample when she went on to say, \'93I don't ever email my mentees and say, \'91What are you doing today?\'92 Or like, \'91Where's this project?\'92 I wait for them to come to me because they are all professionals so I do expect them to check in with me when they need something.\'94 Cecilia\'92s words also highlight the importance of institutional context in shaping behavior, because she justifies her expectations of mentees with the exclamation that they are professionals. Similarly, Annie felt that communication \'93should also be initiated from the mentee, because they are approaching the mentors,\'94 and without that initiative from the mentee, \'93the mentor is lost somehow.\'94 While Type II mentors in this setting believed that the burden of communication was heavier on the shoulders of the mentee, they often explained their perspective as the best solution for them to be helpful and they still believed in being somewhat proactive themselves. Ashley said that it was helpful for a mentee to be proactive, because \'93it helps define my role for them and what they expect out of me." Samantha also explained that while mentees are responsible for a \'93follow-up component,\'94 her own responsibilities included \'93following up on what they are interested in, what I'm offering, and are they interested in me making those interactions.\'94 Another common feature of Type II mentors that appeared in the college sample was the belief that mentees needed to work, reflect, and give feedback to the mentors.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Typical of Type II individuals in the college setting, women mentors also spoke about a mentee\'92s responsibility to direct the experience, be willing to collaborate open-mindedly, reflect on advice, and give feedback. Samantha expressed this expectation when she said, \'93in terms of what I want from them is just kind of the communication and circling back to let me know how things are going, but other than that, I don't really think there's much.\'94 Many men also supported a Type II communicative approach.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The majority of the men mentors in this sample also felt that mentees had the heavier burden of proactivity, and their language was similar to that of the women in the sample. Jason believed that a good mentee is active in executing ideas discussed with the mentor and a good mentee maintains communication with the mentor, but he also understands that mentees can be very busy. Bill expressed similar sentiments when he said that \'93it tends to be more of them pulling than me pushing.\'94 Like Ashley, he explained that it was important for mentees to approach their mentors with questions, because this was how he could be helpful. \'93A few things I can anticipate or when they\'92re asking questions, I can sort of see you know, one or two steps down the road\'85 I wouldn\'92t know what their big issues are unless they communicated those with me,\'94 is how Bill explained his reasons for \'93pushing\'94 less than his mentees were \'93pulling.\'94 However, there were two mentors in the entrepreneur sample, both male, who squarely described their mentoring style as a Type III communicative approach.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Unlike Type II mentors, Type III mentors, who were only ever male, believed that all proactivity and communication was the duty of the mentee, and the mentor should be entirely passive unless summoned. The expectation for deference was squarely on the shoulders of the mentee. For example, Julian stated, \'93I am 100% passive with the companies I help\'85I don\'92t want to be a new source of stress\'85. And I have no gain if they do better faster, right?\'94 He went on to explain that as a mentor, his only job was to communicate in what ways he could help. After that, the mentee needed to be active, because it was the mentee\'92s job to care about their own problems, not the mentor. The following type of rhetoric by Julian distinguished a Type III mentor from Type II.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 It's your company, it's your time, it's your life, it's your whatever, and so you should care. And if you don't care the mentor is just going to go away\'85. if the mentee is not interested, he ceases to contact the mentor and the mentor has better things to do.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The other Type III mentor was Daniel. Though Daniel explained that he has reached out on occasion to check in with his mentees, few of his own mentors had done so, and he believed that reaching out was idiosyncratic to him, rather than a standard of mentorship. Ultimately, the responsibility of maintaining and initiating communication fell \'93a hundred percent on the mentee. Because like, if you're getting a favor done for you, which I feel like mentorship is a favor in some way, um, the mentee needs to be the one to reach out.\'94 The strength of language and the association of mentorship as a favor from a mentor to a mentee distinguished Daniel and Julian as Type III mentors. Though the workplace context overall had higher demands of the mentees, men still expressed greater assertion and influence than woman did, just as status characteristics theory would suggest. Men\'92s higher legitimacy as leaders allows for them to expect compliance to higher expectations of mentees (Correll and Ridgeway 2003).

\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 The entrepreneur sample showed a definitive difference between the distribution of psychosocial and instrumental support offered by male and female mentors. Status beliefs anticipate that women are more competent at socioemotional tasks, such as providing psychosocial support, while men are better suited to give instrumental support (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Particularly in male-dominated career fields such as business and entrepreneurship, men experience more confidence and prestige in their positions. This causes men to occupy more senior level positions, which propagates the expectation that male mentors can offer more career development support than female mentors can (Ridgeway and Smith-Lovin 1999). The behaviors suggested by these status beliefs are more apparent in the workplace sample than the college sample.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 In the entrepreneur sample, women emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial support much more than men did. Seven of the eight women defined a good mentor as one who provided socioemotional support. Stephanie, Laura, Annie, Charlotte, and Samantha all specifically talked about being a good listener. Stephanie\'92s belief that a good mentor is one who is there \'93just to listen and not judge\'94 shows her focus on being a confidant. When Annie expressed that too many people are \'93trying to give to give solutions, but sometimes, they don\'92t understand the problem, because they\'92re not uh, listening effectively,\'94 she also voiced the necessity to be a listener before an authority. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Women were also more likely to emphasize other socioemotional characteristics in good mentors, such as being nonjudgmental, patient, reassuring, open-minded, and loyal. According to Samantha, \'93being trustworthy and loyal\'94 were key to being a good mentor, because a good mentor should encourage the mentorship relationship to be a \'93safe space\'85for them to feel open to really troubleshoot challenges.\'94 Ashley explained the role of the mentor emotionally when I asked her what mentorship meant to her and she responded, \'93first of all, just guidance and cheerleading\'85a big part of it is kind of reassuring, \'91Yes, you're on the right track. Let me point you this way.\'92\'94 Stephanie also spoke strongly about the psychosocial aspect of mentorship when she said that mentoring is \'93to have people you\'92re comfortable reaching out to who can give you guidance and support when you feel like you just don\'92t have it in you to continue.\'94 Two men also mentioned the importance of being a good listener, and one man mentioned empathy and sensitivity as important qualities for mentors to have; as a whole however, men were more goal-oriented and focused on providing instrumental support.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 As performance expectations of men would anticipate, men focused more on instrumental support (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Jason believed that a good mentor is there to help the mentee without any selfish agenda of his own. To do so, he described the process of understanding the business of the mentee and the best possible business strategy for the mentee. All the mentors in this sample mentored executives in early-stage startups, but only the male mentors focused on technical details of business as part of good mentorship. According to Jason, \'93to be the best, to be a good mentor, you have to be able to have the way to lead your team on the right path of having the revenues or the right product or you know.\'94 Bill also described instrumental and career support as important responsibilities of mentors. He believed that he had learned a great deal in his own experience about dealing with different coworkers, professional contacts, and work environments, and he should pass that down to his mentees.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Even the two men mentors who believed that listening is key to being a good mentor, also described instrumental purposes to mentorship. When I asked them about the qualities of a good mentor, George and Daniel both thought immediately of the importance of listening to the mentee; however, they also quickly expressed the necessity for a mentor to give critical advice and have the \'93hard conversations\'94 before they learned their lesson farther along in their careers. Ultimately, these two mentors also fit into the trend of men providing instrumental support. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Women also mentioned instrumental support, but if it came up, it was more as a second thought after mentioning socioemotional support and they offered instrumental support often in the form of social support. Of the four women who mentioned instrumental support, three said that the mentor should offer his or her network to the mentee. In an earlier section, I explained that female mentors in this sample were more motivated than the male mentors by social benefits of mentorship. Not only were women motivated by expanding their own social contacts, but they also were more interested than men in providing instrumental support to mentees by helping mentees network. This sample shows that mentors in this workplace distributed psychosocial and instrumental support in ways that adhered with status beliefs of gender.

\f1\fs24 \ulnone \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In the workplace setting, men and women showed similar self-confidence in instrumental abilities, but men show less self-confidence in their psychosocial abilities. For the entrepreneur sample, women were concerned with lacking expertise as well as being too directive and judgmental, while in the college sample, these two tiers of instrumental self-confidence divided men and women. The important finding of self-confidence in the workplace though was that men in the workplace lacked confidence in their socioemotional skills, while women did not. Three men compared to zero women expressed concern in their soft skills and abilities to have hard conversations with their mentees. While in the college sample, men and women differed in their self-confidence about instrumental support, gender disparities of self-confidence in the workplace centered on psychosocial support.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The women in the workplace sample showed more confidence in their abilities to give instrumental support than the women in the college sample. While Laura and Charlotte both still expressed concern that they might lack the specific expertise their mentee requires, Ana, Stephanie, and Samantha were also concerned about offering feedback without being too prescriptive or judgmental. Although workplace literature suggests that the higher executive positions of men make men more confident and likely to offer instrumental support (Eagly, Makhijani, and Klonsky 1992), my results show that women in the workplace also have confidence in their abilities to give instrumental support. No men were afraid of being overconfident about giving advice, but one man was afraid of lacking experience and knowledge. It appears that the different tiers of instrumental self-confidence are not gendered in the workplace sample.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Instead, there is a distinction in men\'92s comfort in providing psychosocial support. Matt, Bill, and Daniel all focused on the challenge of having hard conversations with their mentees. According to Bill, a lawyer in a large Boston firm, \'93A lot of people, even those kind of quote unquote stereotypical hard-nosed lawyers tend to avoid those conversations\'85. I find it very stressful leading up to them.\'94 When I asked Daniel about the challenges of being a mentor, his first response also centered on the stress of having hard conversations:
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\li960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Sometimes, they don\'92t get to the same answer as you and you really need to give them the hard advice, or you need to give them the old wake-up moment. You know, that\'92s not fun. It\'92s a serious conversation that you need to have. That\'92s definitely one of the challenges.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Bill and Daniel\'92s responses suggest that men mentors are aware of the importance of having these emotionally draining conversations, and they feel uncomfortable enough to cite these situations as challenges. In contrast, the women I spoke with never talked about the \'93hard conversations\'94 they had with mentees. Women care about psychosocial support, as demonstrated by their greater emphasis on the socioemotional mentoring and their concern about being prescriptive and judgmental; however, when it comes to an emotionally charged conversation, they do not cite this as a challenge.
\f1\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Because status beliefs have ingrained in women that their strengths lie in caring and emotional support (Allen and Eby 2004), many women in the workplace may enter mentorship relationships with performance expectations to be an emotional guide. Ashley\'92s statement that \'93people have a lot of self-doubt, and it\'92s very lonely at the top, and so I think a big part of it is reassuring,\'94 is an example of how many women mentors in the workplace expect the mentorship relationship to have an emotional toll. However, the greater focus on instrumental support among men in the workplace, and their concern about their abilities to handle emotionally taxing situations, support that these men might have become mentors without anticipating the emotional toll. While the gender disparities in self-confidence in the workplace are different from the gender disparities in self-confidence in college, status characteristics theory coincide with the results of both cases. While the women mentors did not necessarily demonstrate less self-confidence in this sample, they still indicated that women in this setting had less self-confidence.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Both men and women mentors in the workplace felt that women were less confident of themselves and easily discouraged. In Bill\'92s experience, the men he mentored put forth a sureness in their actions. While he believed that \'93a lot of the male CEOs are really confident in what they know, and they\'92re less likely to check in and solicit other people\'92s opinions,\'94 he did not say the same of women. On the other hand, Daniel felt that women were the opposite. His opinion that \'93The women that I\'92m working with are less, are a bit more self-conscious\'85 I\'92ve seen male entrepreneurs have more of a confident swagger if you will right?\'94 verbalizes what Bill left unsaid in his take on men in his field. Two women and Mark believed that this difference was partially related to a masculinity expectation men felt to be surefooted and assertive in front of particularly other men. Though the women I spoke with did not appear any less confident in themselves than the men were, there was still a general opinion among participants that men still possessed more self-confidence than women.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Even in a workplace setting of younger individuals with less formal hierarchy, it seems that status beliefs about gender still play a role in the mentorship that men and women provide. In terms of motivations for mentoring and balance of psychosocial and instrumental support conferred, the women participants acted more socioemotionally than the men did. Men provided more instrumental support than their women counterparts and demonstrated more autocratic leadership and influence as mentors. This was expected given the higher prestige and confidence men experience in both gender-neutral and masculine tasks (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). While there was no difference in men and women\'92s self-confidence in their instrumental abilities, there was higher concern among men about providing psychosocial support, which also lends to status beliefs about women\'92s competencies in social and emotional tasks. On a whole, the correlation observed between status beliefs and mentor motivations and behaviors was stronger in this sample than in the college sample.\page \page

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 Though gender inequalities have decreased across the board, status beliefs associated with gender are still present and at work in most settings. Status beliefs about gender clearly suggest that women have different competencies than men and that women possess less leadership capacities in gender-neutral and masculine tasks (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). The disadvantages of these gender expectations towards women causes gender inequalities in college and after college. College is an important time for leadership development (Campbell et al. 2012), and based on status beliefs about women\'92s competencies, they are already less suited for positions of authority (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). After college these gender differences manifest in other ways. For example, men receive higher returns on education than women do in the form of earnings (Angle and Wissman 1981). Gaps in pay, rank, and time to promotion between men and women persist although women are entering male-dominated fields in increasing numbers (Wright, et al. 2003; Scandura and Ragins 1993). Not only are men concentrated at positions of greater authority than women are, but men also receive more mentorship that elevates their confidence and statuses (Lockwood 2006; Kay and Wallace 2003).

\f0\fs32 While many researchers have realized that different groups have different access to mentorships and that gender can be a status characteristic that differentiates groups (Lin 2000; Beggs and Hulbert 1997; Scandura and Ragins 1993), I extend this existing research in three main ways. \'a0First, unlike prior research, my study encompasses two settings in which mentorship takes place. Both the college and workplace settings often involve mentorship programs and informal mentorship relationships between older, more experienced members and younger members (Hu and Ma 2010; Ragins and Scandura 1999). Following the effect of gender between these two locations is important in understanding how mentorship changes depending on setting. Second, my research focuses on the mentor, rather than the mentee. Sociological research of mentorship has typically sought to understand only the mentee experience in these relationships; however, the experience of the mentor is key to carving the experience of the mentee. Furthermore, if the mentee\'92s gender yields different mentee experiences (Kay and Wallace 2009), then the mentor\'92s gender should also be significant. Lastly, I integrate theory on status beliefs to understand the expectations and behaviors that mentors describe. A lot of research on gender and mentorship focuses on gender disparities in social capital benefits or the predictive role of gender or gender orientation of mentee experiences and outcomes (Kay and Wallace 2009; Scandura and Ragins 1993). I base my results on the concept of status beliefs, because it is particularly applicable to how men and women perceive themselves as leaders and balance different types of support. Indeed, my results show that status beliefs do offer explanations to mentor expectations and behaviors.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In both the college and workplace sample, I found clear relationships between status beliefs surrounding gender and the actual motivations and behaviors of mentors. Because mentorship is such an important concept in both college and professional institutions, and research shows that mentorship does in fact provide advantages to its recipients and providers, it is also significant to understand how status beliefs affect mentorship when it is delivered by a man or woman. Status beliefs about the different competencies of men and women suggest that they will not provide the same mentorship (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Furthermore, because mentorship is a task of leadership and prestige, it can be considered a masculine task; ergo, not only should men provide different support, but they should also experience higher legitimacy and confidence in that role and its technical requirements (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). My results, which are summarized in Table 5, show that both undergraduate student and young entrepreneur mentors manifest these gender expectations, and more strongly in the professional environment.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 In the college and entrepreneur setting, men and women provided different mentorship. There were gender disparities even in their motivations to mentor. In the college setting, women were motivated by dissatisfaction from their own lack of mentorship earlier at Dartmouth, while men were motivated by potential altruistic, social, cognitive, and personal benefits of mentoring. This is consistent with workplace literature on mentees that showed that women do not receive the same benefits from mentorship even when they do receive mentorship (Kay and Wallace 2009). For the one woman I interviewed who expressed altruistic motivations, her motivations were largely influenced by prior experience that was much more similar to the experience of the college men I interviewed. In the entrepreneur setting, neither men nor women expressed that they had lacked mentorship. This is consistent with prior work that asserts increased career mobility for recipients of mentorship (Lin 2000; Ragins and Scandura 1999). It appears that in achieving a leadership position in their career fields, these women had received mentorship along the way. In the entrepreneur setting, women were more often motivated by social benefits of mentoring than men were, which matches status beliefs about women\'92s social skills (Correll and Ridgeway 2003).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Both settings also show differences in the leadership and communicative approaches of men and women mentors. In the college setting, women were more likely to believe that mentors were responsible for taking all the initiative in the mentorship relationship, while men were more likely to believe that the mentee had responsibilities to the mentor and the mentor\'92s proactivity was conditional to the situation. I refer to these two orientations as Type I and Type II approaches. In the workplace, both men and women demonstrated Type II orientations, but only men ever felt that mentees were entirely responsible for maintaining the relationship. This extremely assertive approach, which I call Type III, has the highest demand on mentee performance and responsibilities. These results support the association of masculinity with leadership and dominance, which gives men leaders legitimacy to act with more assertion than women leaders in the same position (Schilt 2006; Correll and Ridgeway 2003). 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 It was also clear from the results that there is a distinction between the types of support men and women conferred as mentors. In the college setting, men were more likely to talk about technical and career support, though mentors of both genders stressed psychosocial support. The gender distinctions between type of support conferred became starker in the second setting. In this setting, women focused much more on providing socioemotional support and described their roles as those of being a \'93cheerleader\'94 or \'93safe space\'94 for mentees. Men in this setting concentrated more on instrumental support, more frequently describing qualities of a good mentor through technical specifics of business. Jason best exemplified this when he stated that \'93to be a good mentor, you have to be able to have the way to lead your team on the right path of having the revenues or the right product or you know.\'94 Even when women mentors in the workplace setting described instrumental support, they talked about offering instrumental support through social support. Ashely, for example, not only believes that a good mentor is responsible for \'93guidance and cheerleading,\'94 but also \'93connecting, and using my network as much as I can to help them with their connections.\'94 Their comparative focus on socioemotional support stands in contrast to the challenge men felt in providing social support.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 While mentors from both samples believed that women generally are less confident than their male counterparts, the greatest differences in self-confidence between men and women were differences in their confidence about giving psychosocial and instrumental support. Among college mentors, women brought up self-confidence challenges when they said that they were concerned about not having the expertise to help their mentees. I termed this a Tier I challenge. College men, however, showed more confidence in their instrumental abilities. No man expressed a Tier I challenge alone. If they did express a Tier I challenge, they also brought up concern that they were knowledgeable, but wouldn\'92t be as helpful as they could be, or that they were knowledgeable and would be too condescending with their guidance. I termed these two levels of confidence Tier II and Tier III, respectively. In the workplace sample, the men and the women I interviewed both seemed confident in their instrumental abilities, but men showed more concern about situations that required psychosocial support. Women may also find \'93hard conversations\'94 challenging, but given their overall larger focus on socioemotional support and socially-ingrained understanding of their strengths in socioemotional tasks (Schilt 2006), they likely entered the mentorship with expectations of providing that type of support. Overall, it seems that gender is salient in mentorships in both college and workplace settings, but more salient in workplace settings.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 The difference in gender\'92s salience in the two settings can be attributable to several factors. While I tried to contain the entrepreneur sample to young entrepreneurs still in their 20s and 30s, it is possible that participants in the entrepreneur sample still embody more traditional gender expectations that we associate with older individuals. More likely, however, the source of difference is the setting rather than the sample. Though the entrepreneur setting involves close collaboration and little formal hierarchy among members, it is still possible that workplace settings naturally increase the salience of gender and status hierarchies, compared to college settings. Especially in positions of professional leadership, status beliefs about leadership may be even more prominent. Furthermore, the larger representation of men in business settings may also make workplace participants more aware of status beliefs of gender. Another possibility lies in the higher stakes a mentorship relationship places on the mentor\'92s reputation in the workplace than in a college setting (Steele 2012). The success of a mentee can affect the mentor\'92s reputation; in the workplace, mentors are likely more concerned about their reputation than they would be in college due to aspirations of career mobility, promotion, and increased salary. In any case, it is clear that status beliefs are related to mentor expectations and behaviors and the setting moderates the implications of status beliefs.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 It is also important to consider how the settings I chose represented college and workplace settings as a whole. Dartmouth College and entrepreneurial workplaces are not representative of all college and workplace settings. It is possible that mentorships occur at different frequencies or there is something qualitatively different about mentorship experiences at other undergraduate institutions. Dartmouth College is after all a resource-rich, small, liberal arts college. However, this setting increases the likelihood of mentorship relationships developing, which provides richer results for my study. The gender composition of other workplaces might also affect mentorship dynamics and the prevalence of gender expectations. With many students from Dartmouth College pursuing business and other male-dominated fields though, it is appropriate to study an entrepreneur workplace. A female-dominated workplace would possibly lead to different results, but my interests lie more towards the present and future in which women are in high-prestige and high-paying jobs equal to men. It is in these fields that support is most needed. Ultimately, the samples and settings of my study were able to yield important insights towards gender and mentorship.

\f0\fs32 \cf2 It is my hope that the results of this study can contribute to better mentorship experiences for men and women and lessen the gender gap I found women to experience early on in college. For many college students, receiving mentorship improves student success socially and academically and increases commitment to college (Hu and Ma 2010). Women are still underrepresented in certain academic fields, such as STEM and business, which translates into underrepresentation in high prestige career paths. While both academic and work institutions often claim to have mentorship programs for less experienced members, these programs should account for the different mentorship that men and women provide and how the mentors are affected by status beliefs associated with their genders. Since men\'92s social networks tend to be comprised largely of men and mentors tend to gravitate towards mentees with masculine qualities of assertiveness and extraversion (Beggs and Hurlbert 1997; Scandura and Ragins 1993), programs must recognize that men and women may not benefit equally from the programs. My results show that in both college and the workplace, men do not provide the same mentorship that women provide. Since mentorship is such a key way of gaining social capital (Podolny and Baron 1997), this mentorship must be distributed equitably between women and men.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 My recommendations for college and workplace mentorship initiatives are broadly similar. It is clear that in both settings, men and women confer different benefits to their mentees and they have different expectations of their mentees. I do not advise assigning both a man and a woman to every mentee, because that would accentuate different status beliefs about men versus women. \'a0After all, part of the problem is that there are different competencies associated with being a woman and a man. This is also infeasible in workplaces or other settings where men leaders outnumber female leaders. However, I do believe that a diverse set of mentors would confer the most benefits to mentees. Therefore, my recommendation is greater overall participation of older, more experienced members in the growth and development of younger, newer members.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Implementation would be different in the two settings. In the college setting, women often felt that they did not receive support as freshmen. To remedy this issue, mentorship initiatives should be much more selective in choosing mentors and give clearer responsibilities to their mentors. The Dartmouth women who lacked prior experience in mentorship felt as though their mentors were not truly invested in them, community support structures had failed them, or that they were not proactive enough in seeking mentors. Another option is for school organizations to create more freshman outreach events. Because freshmen oftentimes try out different organizations, these organizations should put out more opportunities for freshmen to become integrated into the social networks of upperclassmen. In the workplace, experienced, higher status members should be more involved with and accessible to newer, younger members. This will increase the diversity of mentorship to mentees. Furthermore, compared to the college setting, there is also an even larger disparity between psychosocial support and instrumental support conferred by men and women in the workplace setting. Because of the frequent concentration of men in higher positions, I recommend mentor training that emphasizes the importance of both socioemotional and instrumental support to increase equity in type of support that mentees receive.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 Addressing the status beliefs surrounding gender will be more challenging. Status beliefs about gender are extremely enduring through both time and setting (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). Issues of women lacking confidence in their instrumental skills and lacking assertiveness and legitimacy as leaders will be harder to correct. Similarly, increasing men\'92s emphasis and confidence in their socioemotional skill will also be challenging. However, it is possible to emphasize specific status characteristics that raise women\'92s confidences. Alice was likely more assertive than other women in the college sample, because her prior mentorship experiences gave her specific status characteristics that had a larger impact on her confidence than her diffuse status characteristic of gender. By increasing women\'92s access to mentorship, women might be able to counter status beliefs about gender. Mentorship that specifically addresses and increases their confidence in instrumental skills would be especially useful. For men, they would feel more confident and inclined to provide socioemotional mentorship if they received more psychosocial support in their prior mentorship experiences, particularly in the workplace. Although changing gender expectation is hefty task, it is possible.

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 My results largely support the importance of status beliefs in impacting performance expectations and influence, thus supporting not only the importance and reality of status beliefs about gender, but also expectation states theory and status characteristics theory. While the mentorship relationships in my study were collective and task-oriented, I did not gather the full perspective from both the mentor and mentee side. However, it does appear that the performance expectations and influence mentors assign to themselves and to their mentees follows with these theories (Correll and Ridgeway 2003; Ridgeway and Smith-Lovin 1999). The status beliefs about leadership competencies of men and women colored the interactions between mentors and mentees. There is likely higher deference in the mentees with men mentors than women mentors in both settings. Other processes that propagate gender expectations, such as behavioral interchange pattern and legitimacy also held.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 I found that behavioral interchange patterns lead to status typifications of assertiveness and power of men and women (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). In both settings, men more often demonstrated authority than women did with their mentees. The interactions described between men and their mentees compared to the interactions described between women and their mentees would contribute to beliefs about patterned \'93low-status\'94 and \'93high-status\'94 behavior. The idea of legitimacy is furthermore consistent with my findings of how men and women mentors with the same position do not show the same leadership (Correll and Ridgeway 2003). In both the college and workplace settings, men mentors were more likely to describe their behaviors as assertive and autocratic. According to the concept of legitimacy, it is the person\'92s legitimacy in a position, such as that of a leader, that determines his ability to garner compliance and assert authority. These concepts are also associated with status characteristics theory, a theory based on status beliefs that describes goal-oriented interactions between individuals (Correll and Ridgeway 2003; Ridegeway and Smith-Lovin 1999).

\pard\pardeftab720\fi960\sl760\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs32 \cf2 My results also suggest a need for more sociological research in key areas. While there is abundant work on gender and mentorship in the workplace, academia lacks sociological studies on gender and mentorship during college, which is a key transitional time for many young adults. Furthermore, prior researchers have clearly demonstrated that mentorship provides benefits for its recipients, regardless of the setting. For example, underrepresented and under-resourced students particularly benefit, because they are more likely to pursue further and higher degrees when they receive mentorship (Lang 1986), but in fact, mentorship helps facilitate academic and social integration for all students (Hu and Ma 2010). With more students entering business and entrepreneurship after graduation, workplace mentorship is also highly important and beneficial for mentees (Banir et al. 2011). While mentorship generally has a positive impact on career mobility and enjoyment of work (Ragins and Scandura 1999), other studies have found that mentees in entrepreneurial environments benefit especially due to the availability of information, encouragement, and role models provided through mentorship (Banir et al. 2011). In my study though, I find that men and women mentors do not provide the same benefits to mentees either in the college setting or the entrepreneurial setting. This is concerning, because it generates unequal career outcomes. More work is necessary to explore distinctions in how status beliefs affect the mentorship that different people offer. 
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 While the methodology I chose yielded qualitative narratives and descriptive results, there are other ways of exploring gender and mentorship that bring other benefits. Perhaps future researchers could employ a more quantitative methodology to gain generalizability in the results. A random sample from one location or from several different colleges or several different workplaces could bring this effect. Furthermore, my study was cross-sectional, interviewing each participant at only one point in time. Especially because I was interested in comparing college and workplace mentors, it would be interesting to see the results of a longitudinal study that could provide a closer look at how the expectations and behaviors of mentors changed between these two settings. Lastly, I recommend that future researchers study specific mentorship pairs to learn how gender status beliefs play out in individual interactions. For my study, I did not track down the mentees that my participants spoke about, especially since they often referred to their mentorship experiences generally; however, a close study of mentorship dyads with different combinations of men and women mentor and mentees could be very clarifying. In sum, I highly recommend that future researchers also employ different methodologies to learn more about the role gender plays in mentorship relationships. Despite these limitations, my research provides an important focus on the mentor in mentorship relationships and how status beliefs about gender are influential in mentor expectations and behaviors.\page

\f1\fs24 \cf2 \strokec2 \

\f0\fs32 \cf5 \strokec5 My name is Samantha Cheng, and I am a student at Dartmouth College. To finish my undergraduate degree in the Department of Sociology, I am completing a senior thesis comparing mentorship relationships in collegiate and entrepreneurial environments. This summer, I am interning with Real Food Solutions, one of the MassChallenge finalists, and I will be conducting interviews with entrepreneurs as part of my data collection stage. I would love the opportunity to interview you for my study, and learn about the experience of mentorship from the perspective of a mentor.
